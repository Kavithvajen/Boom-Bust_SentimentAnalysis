# Boom-Bust_SentimentAnalysis
A unique project in which we aim to analyse a large corpus to find if the author's description of the protagonist's sentiments correlate to the GDP of the era the text was written in. This is a project undertaken by Shuchita Kapoor, Chavvi Chandani, Akash Verma and Kavithvajen Kamaraj as part of coursework for the module 'Text Analytics (CS7IS4)' at Trinity College Dublin.

## To run:

1. `source  taTest/bin/activate`
2. `python test.py`

## To directly check the output:

1. Open the "sentenceAnalysis.json" file
2. Copy all the contents of the file
3. Find some JSON formatter website (I use https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print)
4. Paste the contents on the left and click on "Make pretty"
5. Now, you must be able to visualise the output a teensy bit better.
