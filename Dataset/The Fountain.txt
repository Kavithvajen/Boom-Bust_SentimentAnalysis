“ from outward forms to win 
The passion and the life, whose fountains are within ” 

Coleridge Defection 


When a man proceeding onwards from terrestrial thmgs 
by the right way of loving, once comes to sight of that 
Beauty, he is not far from his goal And this is the 
right way he should begin by loving earthly things 
for the sake of the absolute loveliness, ascendmg to that 
as it were by degrees or steps, from the first to the second, 
and thence to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair 
conduct, and from fair conduct to fair principles, until 
from fair principles he finally arrive at the ultimate 
principle of all and learn what absolute beauty is This 
life, my dear Socrates, said Diotima, if any life at all is 
worth living, is the life that a man should live, m the 
contemplation of absolute Beauty

Be still, my soul, be still, the arms you bear are brittle

CHAPTER ONE 

On an afternoon of January 1915, a small tram dragged 
itself across the flat Dutch countryside m the neighbour- 
hood of Bodegraven, carrying a group of English officers 
under guard Their heads appeared continually at the win- 
dows, for, though their destination had been kept from 
them, they judged by a restless movement of the guard that 
they were near the end of their journey 

Lewis Alison, a dark, craggy man of more than common 
height, gave no sign of sharing in the general curiosity He 
stayed m his place, seeming to have wrapped himself in a 
composure not easily to be disturbed Thirty years had left 
upon him more than their accustomed mark — not upon his 
physical appearance only, but upon his manner, delaying 
his smile and giving an air of deliberateness to his speech 
and movement Vigour and eagerness lay m his eyes, and 
his hair, full and black, had the glisten of youth upon it, 
his body was pliant and his cheeks could darken with colour 
when whipped by excitement, but his good looks were of 
maturity, and owed so much to something austere and self- 
disciplined m his expression that it was hard for one who 
had not known him m the past to imagine him as a very 
young man, sanguine and impetuous But while he sat in 
this tram, which the early twilight of winter was already 
filling with shadow, even his boyhood might have been 
guessed at by one who watched him closely When he 
spoke, there was m his voice a mingling of quietness 
and animation which made him master of his company 
Throughout the morning and the afternoon he had spoken 
little A book on his knee had occupied him, and the

turn of his fingers as he lifted a page suggested a loving 
reader 

Among the Englishmen in the tram were a few airmen, 
brought down by engine-failures into neutral territory, but 
the greater number were of the Naval Division that had 
retreated from Antwerp three months earlier Separated 
from their men, with whom they had been living m an in- 
ternment camp at Groningen, they were now being taken 
to closer imprisonment in a fortress In Lewis’s compart- 
ment were two former sergeants of marine, Lapham and 
Shordey, upright m opposite corners like dogs on trust, 
Ballater, long and fair and handsome, stretched out at ease, 
and Sezley, still so much of a boy that, when he withdrew 
his head and shoulders from the window and turned round 
to communicate m high excitement what he had seen or 
guessed or thought of, his words came tumbling over one 
another, and he had often to stop and draw breath m an 
audible gasp before he could continue Other officers had 
from time to time wandered in from the corridor, stayed 
a little while and gone 

“This fort we're going to, ” Lapham was saying “Wonder 
what kind of a place it is? Ever served m a fort, Shordey?” 

Shordey's eyes twinkled above his puffy cheeks Now, as 
always, he seemed about to make a joke, but he shook his 
head and said nothing 

“I did once,” Lapham continued “At Sheerness Windy 
sort of place But I didn't mind it The young officers did, 
though ” 

“You had the wife with you,” Shordey said 

Ballater smiled and, seeing that Lewis had at last closed 
his book, asked “Do you imagine we're going to be shut 
up m this place for ever, Alison? I can't get the idea 
of it ” 

Lewis took up a pipe from the seat beside him and tapped 
it on his boot 

“I've been trying all day to get the idea of it,” he replied 
“It's odd m these days and oddest of all m the middle of 
a war But it wouldn't have seemed odd m the past — to be 
shut up Whole communities shut themselves up I've often

thought Pd like to go round the world m a sailmg-ship 
Day after day, nothing but your own job ” 

“What did these fellows shut themselves up for, Alison?” 
Shordey asked, wrenching himself out of his speechless- 
ness “What was the idea? Religion and so on?” 

Lewis hesitated The answer to that question would be 
an answer to all the questions that had for many hours, 
for many years, perplexed and enchanted him Then, sud- 
denly, fascinated by so profound a riddle, he began to speak 
of the monastic ideal of earlier ages, saying that there were 
two aspects of it, the devotional and the contemplative 
“The struggle for some kind of stillness within oneself 
seems to run right through history,” he said “In cities and 
market-places as well as m monasteries In forts, too, and 
camps and prisons It’s a question of how to attain it To 
worship a particular god is only one means, so is seclusion, 
neither, perhaps, is a necessary means ” Even Sezley turned 
from the window to listen to him His audience was held 
by his argument and by the evidence of his eyes and voice 
that he had deep personal concern m it He said much that 
surprised them, but nothing for effect — nothing that did 
not spring from within himself 

“I believe you’d have been a monk if you’d lived then,” 
Ballater said “You’d like to be a monk now if you had the 
chance ” 

Lewis at first made no reply Then “I’ve no sort of re- 
ligious vocation,” he answered “Anyhow I have a business 
to run and people dependent on me But m the fort,” 
he went on with hungry eagerness, “there’ll be none of 
that As long as we live, it’s the only chance that any of us is 
likely to have to be completely independent ” He checked 
himself abruptly and leaned back m his corner 

“It’s all very well for you,” Ballater said “You won’t 
be without a job You have your history to write ” 
“Without the history,” Lewis replied, “I’d still be glad 
of the fort ” 

“But who’s to look after the business?” Lapham asked 
“What’s your line, Alison?” 

“Publishing Alison and Ford Educational books mostly,

i 


and books of reference ” Lewis's words came from him m 
jerks, forced by a reluctant memory of the past “I've been 
at it ten years I took my father’s place when he died Up- 
hill work Still,” he added, “that’s over Everything be- 
gins afresh to-day ” 

But Lapham’s mind had run on 
“You may have your history,” he said “But what’s the 
rest of us to do? We’re not all monks by a long chalk No 
women an’ no job It’s worse for the married men than the 
single, though you may think different, Ballater ” 

Ballater replied cautiously “As for girls, the old mon- 
asteries didn’t always keep them out ” 

“They’ll get m somehow — never you mind,” Lapham 
said after a moment’s reflection “Visitors’ days Poodle- 
fakmg m the dog-watches Women never leave you alone 
They come m like water into an old ship First your mother 
Then your wife Then, when you think you’re through 
with it, your daughter worrym’ at you You never get clear 
This fort mayn’t be as peaceful as you looks for, Alison 
Things have a way of coming m, you know ” 

“They have indeed,” Lewis answered “I’ve spent my 
life finding that out ” 

The tram groaned, rattled and was silent It had stopped 
without show of reason among the meadows 
“It can’t be here,” Sezley cried, leaning out yet farther 
“There’s no station, no platform, nothing ” 

But a Dutch captain with a precise voice and a blonde, 
silky moustache went from compartment to compartment, 
smiling and repeating monotonously “Will the gentlemen 
please to go down here?” 

“Like a butler announcing dinner,” Ballater said 
“Yes,” the captain was heard to explain, “this is the 
place There is Wierickerschans, the fortress where you go 
— you see the ramparts with the trees over? That is your 
new country mansion ” 

Alison rose and slipped his book into his pocket Six 
months ago he had been travelling every day from home 
to office, from office to home, having no thought that his 
way of life could ever be changed Even the desire for a 



CH I

different life had fallen asleep within him This evening, 
when he took up that volume again, the gates of the fort 
would have closed For months, perhaps for years, they 
would not be opened 
“Come on,” he said “Let’s get out ” 

Coat collars were turned up, pipes lighted and khaki caps 
pressed down against a blustering wind The Englishmen 
climbed on to the line With a guard of some fifty Dutch 
privates shambling before and after them and the blonde 
officer m their midst, they set out across country 


Ballater and Lewis Alison walked together At Antwerp 
they had served m the same battalion but m different com- 
panies, and not until they had passed several weeks m 
Gromngen were they drawn into a loose friendship What 
bound them was not a shared interest but a humorous liking 
or tolerance that each had for the other’s foibles 

“Personally,” Ballater said, “monasteries aren’t m my 
line No opening for talent ” His face, clear red and white 
in complexion, moved m an easy smile 

Lewis wondered what Ballater would do in the fort What 
would they all do? — and he looked at the men surrounding 
him Some were naval officers or former naval officers re- 
joined for the war, some schoolboys, still in the adventure 
of a commission, no older than his own brother who had 
been killed at his side during the crossing of the Scheldt 
Some, like himself, were mature civilians, brought by a 
medley of chances into the Naval Brigades Lapham and 
Shordey, being old soldiers, would make themselves snug 
m Purgatory itself, anxious only that marching-orders 
should not disturb them They would settle down to a 
routine of pipes and beer and five-cent Nap, outwardly 
resigned But imprisonment, even the easy imprisonment 
that lay before them all, was a distmguisher of men None 
knew what would befall him here nor what he might be- 
come 

Lewis was possessed by the fantasy of this mild walk 
into prison Near him, Hernot, a Flying Corps pilot, 
and Dacres, his observer, were plodding on, shoulder to

i 


shoulder Even Dacres’s chubby face wore an expression of 
melancholy — a grotesque, ridiculous crumpling He was 
taking stock of the Dutch guards, the broad fields, the 
chances of a dash for liberty When he spoke of this, 
Hernot growled and shook his head “Not a hope We’d 
be in the dykes ” 

They went on m silence, and Lewis knew what bitter- 
ness was in Hernot’s mind Dacres was an amateur of ad- 
venture, if he did not escape he would soon console him- 
self, but Hernot was a dry, frosted little man, cool, wary, 
without illusions, and to fly was his life He cared for 
nothing else except unending games of pa+ience Flight was 
to him a necessary drug, without it his imagination became 
erratic and his fingers twitched above the cards “I must 
get out,” he had said at Groningen “This war’s my one 
chance There’ll never be another until I’m too old ” He 
lifted his grooved, sallow face out of the collar of his coat 
and gazed at the fort, a tree-lined eminence seemingly 
afloat on the ground-mist 

“Well, Alison Like the look of it ? This ought to be the 
place for you Though why, I doubt if I understand What 
is it you want ? ” 

“That’s a hard question ” 

“I know — but answer it ” 

“If I say that what I want is peace of mind ” 

“That’s too vague,” Hernot interrupted “May mean 
anything Lapham has peace of mind when he’s had a good 
dinner and ms pipe is drawing ” 

Lewis hesitated “There’s no answer to your question, 
he said, “that doesn’t sound like a boast What I want 
is stillness of spmt ” 

“It doesn’t sound like a boast except to fools,” Hernot 
answered “It’s what we all want — though damned few of 
us know it But it’s to be found m an office or an aeroplane, 
not only in a hermit’s cell Some people have to shut 
themselves up Maybe that way’s right for them Depends 
on the man If the wrong man dives into solitude he goes 
mad— or, what’s worse, he goes stale Why you should shut 
yourself up, I don’t know You’re not one of the incapables

of this world I know your story, Ballater told it me, and 
a man who’s left m charge of his family when he’s still an 
undergraduate and pulls a business out of the fire isn’t an 
incompetent It’s not the sort of efficiency that I’m capable 
of A mother, two sisters, a young brother to educate — I’d 
have deserted them in a week I did desert my own wife 
and children Still, if you can stick that, you can stick most 
things ” 

“It wasn’t altogether a question of sticking it,” Lewis 
said “It was at first In a way it was right up to the end 
But I don’t take a hero’s credit I began to be proud of it — 
almost to like it That’s the devil of it all — that half of me 
began to like it But running a business and a family wasn’t 
what I wanted to do This” — he lifted a hand towards the 
fort — “is what I’ve wanted inside me all my life ” 
“Well,” Hernot said, “to every man his own fanaticism 
— as long as he’s got one It’s a queer choice for you to 
make You can do your job outside and do it damned well 
Men like your company And women too, ’ ’ he added, shoot- 
ing a glance upward “You could play hell with them if it 
amused you You look as if you’d burn them up with your 
austerity — and that’s a candle they’ll always die m Not all 
women, perhaps — the silly ones like a smoother passage — 
but the women worth having Look, man, there’s what 
Ballater calls your monastery Shout 1 Why don’t you shout 
and sing and dance? I should if I saw an Avro make a land- 
ing m that field, ready to take me away ” 

“No, you wouldn’t,” Lewis said “You’d be too excited 
to speak and too doubtful whether you’d get clear This 
is my chance, but God knows what I shall do with it ” 
“Nothing would keep me from my job,” Hernot ex- 
claimed “Not a hundred mothers and sisters and brothers 
— nothing but that prison Nothing ever has But this place 
is the end for me, if I can’t get out of it quick Observe 
the corpse walking to its grave ” 

In the fierce extravagance of that jest there was so deep 
a sadness that Lewis could find no answer to it There were 
peace and joy m his own heart In the fort, he imagined, 
day would follow day m slow, empty routine He would

look out over this calm, mist-bound country that separated 
him from all external claims and watch the spring appear 
In summer, greenness would enrich it, m autumn, the few 
belts of trees would flame and darken, this winter or next 
there would be a snowfall and the canals would become a 
network of black cords laid upon the snow Hour after 
hour, season after season, in no conflict of duties, he would 
do what all his life he had wished to do 

“Pd like to be a saint,” said Herriot suddenly 

“A saint — why?” 

“It would be exciting, that’s why Anything is that you 
can go mad about The hopelessly sane men are the bores 
Dacres, for instance ” He jerked his thumb “A good fel- 
low, but sane as a stationmaster You have the merit of be- 
ing mad, Alison Half-mad anyway Lord m heaven, think 
of going mad about a history book! And a history of the 
contemplative life at that 1 That’s what you want to write, 
isn’t it? It’s a good world when you see the joke of it ” And 
he added slowly “I suppose there’s a technique of con- 
templation — same as m flying You’ve got to learn it from 
ABC And no good then if you haven’t the right nerve ” 

They were approaching the fort — a high flat mound that 
was evidently a hollow square, for above the grassy ram- 
parts were visible the tops of trees growing within on a 
lower level On each of the great earthen bastions at the 
corners of the square was a wood of tall elms A canal, 
wider than any common moat, lay about the base of the 
ramparts It had been made, they soon discovered, to en- 
circle the fortress, to which a guarded bridge was the 
only entrance As Lewis crossed the bridge, he paused, 
with a feeling of delight and finality, to look down into the 
waters of the canal 

Inside was a paved courtyard, flanked by buildings 
chiefly of one storey — long narrow bungalows stretching 
out on either side to the mil breadth of the old fortress 
High above their roofs stood the gatehouse rampart, a 
steep bank already equipped with arc-lamps, sentry-boxes 
and barbed wire It overshadowed the room that Lewis

found was to be his dormitory Through the windows on 
one side, nothing was to be seen but this great rampart 
and a narrow path that divided it from the buildings On 
the other side, the prospect was more open Here, beyond 
the path, were a few yards of turf, fringed with barbed 
wire and bordered by a stagnant inlet from the moat The 
mam ramparts of the fortress rose out of the farther bank 
of this strip of water Their earthy bulk stood across the 
world, but above them and their soaring elms the twilit 
sky was visible From this quarter m the daytime the sun 
would for a little while make its way into the room 
Ballater and Lewis chose beds within a few feet of each 
other and sat down upon them Baggage was being brought 
m, but their own was not yet come and they had nothing 
to do Other officers, whose place was in this dormitory, 
were standing about in knots, hesitant and restless “What 
are we going to do here?” Ballater said “We shall be 
lucky if we aren’t at each other’s throats m a fortnight ” 
Sezley was handing round lumps of marching chocolate 
“Rations for the troops!” He was as excited as a girl at a 
party 

Among the baggage that had come was Sezley’s gramo- 
phone He turned it on, and soon Lauder’s voice was 
grinding into the dusk Someone began to sing, was 
shouted down, and persisted m his singing A chorus 
sprang up and m the midst of it the gramophone choked 
and died A grey hush fell on the room 

“This place will be damp, so near the water,” and 
Ballater stared up at the whitewashed walls It was now 
too dark to see whether they were patched with wetness 
Sezley was examining his gramophone “Can’t see a 
thing Anyone got some matches?” He looked over his 
shoulder at the brass oil-lamps hung from the ceiling A 
chair was dragged across the boarded floor, a match fizzed 
and illumined the faces looking upward “No oil ” But 
Sezley prevailed among the shadows, soon a jarrmg of the 
needle was changed to a stifled rag-time, and Ballater said 
“That’s one of the snags to your monastery You won’t 
have a room to yourself night or day ”

But nothing could now disturb Lewis's tranquillity 
While he sat on his bed and the noise of the room drummed 
upon him, his mind returned to a time when, still a child, 
he had felt that he was at the gate of a mystery which, if 
he could but open his eyes anew, would be revealed to 
him To learn how to open his eyes it had seemed neces- 
sary that he should be alone, that he should be still with 
an absolute stillness, until his self that vas blind had fallen 
from him like the skm of a snake Within the apparent 
form of all things was another form, waiting to appear, 
within stones another stone, within the vitality of trees a 
secret and ghostly sap, beyond God who, he had been 
taught, was his Father m Heaven, another god whose being 
sprang, not from instruction and rule, but from his own 
apprehension As he grew older, he had perceived m cer- 
tain books that their authors had been seeking what he 
sought, and scholarship had become a passion in him, a 
means, not of learning only, but of association with minds 
coloured as his own To their diverse voyages he would 
now return, seeking always m them that discipline of still- 
ness beneath which, if any man perfectly attained it, his 
blind self might be shed like the skin of a snake, and he 
be changed 

He went out into the dusk, wishing to visit the ram- 
parts before others came and to walk among the great elms 
on the bastions But there was a gate, heightened with 
barbed wire and padlocked, across the path leading from 
the courtyard on to the mam ramparts, and a Dutch lieu- 
tenant appeared out of the arc-lamp shadow of an elder 
bush to say that he might not go by that way until mor nin g 

“It would be too simple,” he explained m an English 
that came from him uneasily, as though, while he spoke, 
he were nervously collecting it from a book of idioms 
“The outer ramparts cannot m the night be closely guarded 
You would escape, met waar 

Escape All day that word had been repeated — in the 
train, m the meadows, by groups of men unpacking their 
gear and setting up photographs m the dormitories They 
had chattered of tunnels ana barges and disguise They

would learn Dutch, they said, and had asked Lewis, who 
had already made progress m the language, whether 
he would help them As he walked under the darkening 
and austere sky, watching an electrician m overalls inspect 
an arc-lamp circuit, the word escape seemed to come to 
him from another age It was a thing you could pick up 
between your fingers and toss m your hand like an old 
com, thinking of the remote world m which it was cur- 
rency But he heard his own mind say “It’s our job to 
get out of this place if we can,” and his eyes were on the 
barbed wire, testing it 

In the messroom, he found Hernot with his patience 
cards, sitting at the end of a long empty table covered m 
red chenille 

“Cut to me, Alison, and bring me luck I’ve made a 
bet with myself Every card I don’t get out keeps me in 
this place a week ” 

Lewis stretched across the table and cut the pack 



CHAPTER TWO 


Though a letter from his mother came m each English 
mail, and Janet, the elder of his sisters, sent out copies of 
The Times m which local casualties were marked m red 
ink, more than a month passed before any sign was given 
that Lewis’s request for his books had been received At 
last his mother wrote 

The books and notes you asked for have been 
sent I fear you will think we have been slow m sending 
them, but everything in England is so difficult nowadays 
— so many forms and regulations, and things one needs to 
do for the men, and the poor brave fellows who are fight- 
ing must come first, as you, dear, much though you love 
your books, would be the first to admit And besides, 
now that Nancy is married, Janet and I have to do every- 
thing, and it was always Nancy you told about your things 
She knew where to lay her hand on them 

“Before I forget — I met Mr Ford in London the other 
day and he said I was to be sure to tell you the business 
keeps steady, but all publishing is very slack He has to 
do everything himself now you are away, and he is getting 
old, but he will carry on, he said, without you I think he 
has always been a little touchy because the business im- 
proved so much after you joined it when your poor father 
passed away I have never liked him So different from 
his daughter Oh, Lewis, I do wish your engagement to 
Elizabeth had not been broken off It always seemed so 
suitable to me 

“But about your books I was surprised when your 

14 



CH II

i5 

letter came For a time I could not make myself think 
about books — it seemed so strange that you should care 
to think of them in these dreadful days when we have all 
one object only, to avenge our dead Vengeance is mine, 
saith the Lord, I will repay But we must help Even m 
the little work Janet and I do here at home we feel that 
It is a consolation But afterwards I said to myself you 
must have your books since you asked for them and God 
has decided you may take no more part in this struggle 
unless Holland is shamed into doing as Belgium did So 
I went up to your room, past poor Peter’s door (his little 
place is just as he left it and some of his writing still on 
the blotter), and I looked for the books and papers as you 
told me How many you had in that locked cupboard^ 

I used to think it was account-files you kept there Some 
on your list I could not find I grew tired looking, and I 
thought you would not mind, but there will be enough to 
occupy you m your sad idleness In the end it was Elizabeth 
who packed them and arranged to have them sent She 
wanted to look for others, too, but I had burned your list 
by then She has never really told me how your engage- 
ment was broken off when she visited you m the camp at 
Walmer She says you both wished it, but I have never 
heard of such a case I used to think she was such a well- 
balanced girl — always so quiet and so modest about the 
share m the business and the money she will have from 
her father some day But perhaps the war has upset her 
m more ways than one You cannot imagine what trouble 
I have had with the maids since the camp began m Harbury 
Park* Young people of every class seem to be very much 
on edge When I told Elizabeth that you were to be moved 
to a moated fortress from which it would be impossible to 
escape, she said ‘Thank God* That’s his chance, then ’ 
Of course I am thankful you are safe, and if she had been 
still engaged to you I might have expected her to say what 
she did, but she told me, when I asked her, that she was 

t lad because for once you would be compelled to stop 
ghtmg other people’s battles and to lead your own life # 
What she meant I really don’t know I said, how could

she say such a thing > — as though she thought you would 
rather be reading m idleness She could not answer me, of 
course, but went on cording the crate without looking at 
me So strange And when I thought it was done with, 
she found a volume slipped under a chair — one of Plato’s 
it was and m Greek — and she would open up the crate 
again and put it m I am sure that I was right and that, 
though she is now a little overwrought, she is still genuinely 
fond of you, as you will find on your return, whatever 
may have happened at Walmer I should go on writing to 
her if I were you 

“I envy you, dear, being able to settle down so easily 
to your old hobby I wish I could read It would distract 
my mmd But since Peter was taken I keep thinking that 
if he had been on your left instead of on your right when 
the piece of shell came, he would have been spared, and 
I am always picturing the dreadful scene It comes between 
me and my book and I can read nothing but a newspaper 
But you are more composed That is wiser and better, I 
suppose, if one is capable of it The books left here three 
days ago ” 

Lewis took the letter with him on to the ramparts, in- 
tending to read it again as he walked, but a green wood- 
pecker came over, summoning him, and, with a delicious 
flight of the mmd, he watched it on to a tree on the 
farther side of the moat Here, m meadows sparsely 
bordered with willow and poplar, lambs with great ears 
and spindly legs were hastening after ponderous, greyish 
ewes Now and then he could hear their bleating, borne 
to him on a thm, wintry breeze that scudded the surface of 
the water, and rooks were pairing m the elms overhead 
Winter is breaking up, he said, and into the calm thought 
that among the many birds m this place he had seen neither 
blackbird nor thrush and but one robin, another thought 
was thrust like a dagger — that the break-up of this winter 
was herald of a campaign 

Fifty years hence the little girl among the ewes m the

at Wierickerschans she had seen figures, said to be those 
of Englishmen, moving to and fro, but she would have no 
care for them or for the remote wars The lambs, with their 
absurd, stumbling grace, might enter into the pattern of 
her mmd, or the heron, solitary inhabitant of the marsh, 
and Lewis knew that he also would see the heron and the 
lambs, and hear again the movement of the rooks above 
him, when all else of this day had fallen to greyness and 
the trivial gleams of the past, would see them, it might be, 
when he was unable to imagine his mother’s face, so long 
would she then have been m her grave Now, with the 
crumple of her letter m his fist, he imagined her at her 
little table m the morning-room, saw how the sunshine 
revealed the white in her iron hair, listened to the dashing 
strokes of her nib She was noisy and violent m nothing 
else, but she wrote, m a jingle of bangles, as if each corre- 
spondent were a mobilized army hungry for dispatches 
and each post the last Only the letters she sent to Peter 
at school had been written on her knee by the fire, silently 
and m pencil 

Looking back on his past and on his mother’s letter 
which seemed to have sprung from it, he smiled over them 
as he would have smiled over the narrative of another’s 
life, the life of a friend whose secrets he was but now be- 
ginning to understand He had always supposed that it was 
the need to maintain his home that had bound him to it 
— that, and his mother’s reliance upon him But what 
bound me, he said now, was what always keeps men from 
going their own way and he could not complete the 
thought Some flaw m himself, perhaps Or was the world, 
m the exercise of its power over one who wished to become 
independent of it, subtler than the moralists commonly 
supposed, binding him, not by his vice or weakness, but 
by his strength and a flattery of his virtues ? The gnp of 
a wife, he thought, not the inducements of a mistress 

The packing-case at last followed his mother’s letter 
Sezley ran into the smoking-room with news of its arrival 
It was necessary, he knew, to the writing of “the history,’*

which, because he liked Lewis, he had romanticized m his 
impetuous mind He entered from the courtyard with the 
headlong floundering of a puppy, for he expected to find 
Lewis alone The emergence of a senior baldhead and a 
pair of blood-rimmed eyes from behind a lowered copy 
of the Statesman of Calcutta abashed him, but he was nor 
abashed for long The crown and star on Jedwell’s shoulder- 
strap had not m the fort their Indian validity, and anyhow 
he hadn’t been by any means a colonel when he retired 
Sezley drew m his breath to speak Then, seeing that 
Lewis, at the table by the window, was writing, he hesi- 
tated again and advanced a few paces — over Jedwell’s feet 
— without speaking 

“Oh, you’re only writing a letter*” he exclaimed at last 
“That’s all right I say, your books have come, Alison 
There’s a whacking great packmg-case dumped m B Three 
Going to open it now? Shall I help?” 

Lewis was glad to put away his letter It was to Elizabeth 
and hard to write Words that had been the currency of 
their betrothal might pass no more between them, and 
there was as much artificiality now m the deliberate omis- 
sion of these words as had formerly crept into their use 
She also would feel the constraint “A bleak letter,” she 
would say, and her little smile would shroud the death 
within her He remembered the first touch of that death — 
how once, while he kissed her and her body clung to him, 
she had known suddenly that his mind was not in her 
passion, that he was waiting for her to cease Her know- 
ledge had been the cause of knowledge in him She had 
not understood, nor he, they had been silent and had 
fought long against the truth At last, bidding him farewell 
at Walmer, she had accepted — with how much courage* — 
what he could not deny To wnte to her now m the chilled 
idiom of friendship, to wound her with each careful gentle- 
ness — but there was no other way m which he might write, 
none less cruel Except when he made himself wnte to 
her, she was never m his thoughts He was wnting to a 
stranger

like the squirt of a siphon,” the statesman of Calcutta re- 
marked, removing the gold rims of his glasses from the 
red rims of his eyes 

“Sorry, sir ” 

“And will you please notice that there is an abundance 
of floor-space not occupied by my feet?” 

Sezley was baffled by so much elaboration “Sorry, sir,” 
he repeated “My fault ” 

“Your fault? Not at all The fault of the god who made 
you ” 

Sezley had not the gift of silence “Anyhow,” he said, 
the colour rising m his cheeks, “I don’t see what there is 
to make all that fuss about I didn’t tread on your feet I 
cleared them I ” 

“What are these books of yours, Alison?” Jedwell amiably 
intervened “Something to read?” And the question, as he 
considered it, not seeming to be as intelligent as he had 
hoped, he added “Nothing much to do m this hole except 
read ” 

“Alison’s writing a history, sir,” Sezley answered, his 
temper past 

“But history,” Jedwell said, “is being made A his- 
tory, may I ask, of what?” 

Lewis might have let the question slide, it had been 
asked for the sake of asking But he could not resist watch- 
ing Jedwell’s face and saying 

“A history of the contemplative life ” 

“The what?” 

“The contemplative life — particularly in England since 
the Renaissance ” 

“But who lives it?” 

“You know India and I don’t, sir, but isn’t it true that 
in India ” 

“In India, yes I know But you said England Who lives 
it there? Who and how and why and with what effect?” 

“That’s a goodish summary of my book,” Lewis said 

The Statesman of Calcutta fell to the floor A lively 
interest had made Jedwell a changed man 

“Are you really writing that book — seriously? Then let

me tell you this You can’t write about the contemplative 
life unless you’re the sort of man capable of living it ” 

“I know,” Lewis said “It's much more important to 
me to become a man of that sort than to write the history 
But you must have a concrete task to live by while you’re 
learning — worshipping God, or shepherding, or illuminat- 
ing manuscripts, or writing a history It’s all one ” 
Jedwell twisted a button on his tunic “I see That 
sounds like sense Look here,” he added, his hand shaking 
a little and his eyes coming up in compelled shyness, “if 
you want the Indian stuff — and I don’t see how you can 
do without it — I know about that, or did once Might have 
been better for me if I’d known a bit less Lot of good it’s 
done me Still, we might talk, if you care to ” 

Sezley had been swinging Lewis’s attache case on his 
finger 

“Aren’t you coming, Alison?” he said, and, as they 
crossed the courtyard “What’s the matter with Jedwell? 
I’ve never seen him like that He doesn’t know anything 
about it, does he?” 

“Yes, he does,” Lewis answered 
They went to the dormitory together In it, hunched 
over a drawing-board, was Ferrard, a naval officer who, 
like Ballater, had left the Service as a midshipman, a Scot 
with high cheek-bones and tight lips and dark, curving eye- 
brows that gave to his face an expression of amusement 
and surprise The white sun of early March shone on his 
paper Looking over his shoulder, Lewis saw a map of 
the fort 

“Alison’s books have come,” Sezley cried 
“What the hell does he want books for?” Ferrard an- 
swered, carefully wiping the pen that he was using for red 
ink Then he became aware that Lewis was at his side His 
eyebrows went up into his forehead and his Ups flickered 
into a smile He grasped Lewis’s arm “Look here, Alison,” 
he said, “you can help me,” and while he explained his 
difficulties they leaned over the map together The greater 
part of its outline was complete — the two islands connected 
by a narrow arm of land, on the smaller, the courtyard,

the dormitories, the gatehouse and the bridge leading to 
the outer world, on the larger, the square of the main ram- 
parts with a vast quadrangle, containing the garrison’s 
quarters, enclosed m it, and, at its corners, the wooded 
bastions “It’s the external dimensions that worry me ” 
He pointed with his pencil “What’s the breadth of the 
outer canal — there**” 

“Does it matter?” Lewis said 

“I don’t want to leave anything to chance ” Ferrard 
lowered his voice that he might not be overheard “I’ve a 
Belgian m Rotterdam making outside arrangements I want 
him to have his car — there And either there or 

there I shall do my get-away It will be dark We might 
not make contact unless the staff-work’s perfect — so this 
map ” 

As they discussed the scheme, Lewis perceived a flaw 
m it and suggested an amendment 

Ferrard looked at him “You’re a queer bloke, Alison 
Thanks for the idea But why did you tell it to me?” 

“Isn’t it useful?” 

“I know But if I’d had it, I should have kept it to 
myself ” 

“It’s not so precious as all that ” 

“It’s damned good ” 

“You’re an enthusiast, Ferrard, you know ” 

“Well, we all are on this job ” Ferrard was about 
to speak again, checked himself, sucked a paint-brush and 
considered his words “Look here, I’ll tell you what I’ll 
do,” he said at last, with the seriousness of a diplomat 
conceding a continent “I’m tied up m this scheme with — 
with two other people And it won’t work for more than 
three But one of them thinks he may have a better line 
elsewhere Anyhow he may not be able to raise the cash 
If he falls out, I’ll take you m Or perhaps you’ve 
something of your own?” He added swiftly “No, that’s 
not a fair question Let’s leave it at that If there’s 
a vacancy, I’ll give you first refusal No need to decide 
now ” 

But why this elaboration of map-drawing? Lewis won-

dered as he turned away towards the packing-case, sum- 
moned by Sezley’s shout for attention Why the coloured 
inks, the pamt-box, the measured printing, the dolphin 
and compass in the north-west corner^ The Belgian m 
Rotterdam would not profit by so much decoration It was 
unlike Ferrard to waste his time He was a good officer, a 
quick, unspectacular worker Only in the fort, where all 
men were changed, would he have drawn dolphins earnestly 
as though persuaded that he might escape on their backs 
Sezley was prizing open the packmg-case, and Lewis 
saw at once how small a part of his library could be con- 
tained m it His task appeared before him like an impene- 
trable forest, it seemed that he had been pretentious and 
childish He sat back on his heels before the packing-case, 
thinking My history is little nearer than it was, but his 
discouragement vanished as soon as he had a volume m his 
hands In the packmg-case it had been separated from 
the others It’s the Plato, he thought, that Elizabeth put 
m at the last moment But she passed from his mind, he 
could think only of his books, their names suggesting to 
him many connected posts m the historical system that he 
had imagined Since the Renaissance, contemplation, by 
which he meant the stilling of the soul within the activities 
of the mind and body so that it might be still as the axis 
of a revolving wheel is still, had taken new forms and had 
cultivated in old forms a new significance Mathematics, 
perceiving and measuring the order of external nature, had 
discovered m new men those very qualities that the per- 
ception of God had discovered m their predecessors Might 
not this unity be the unity of his history? He saw the books 
before him as the quarries from which stone for his build- 
ing was to be hewn Sezley turned them over and built 
them into patterns When pillars of books stood upon the 
floor, Heber’s edition of Jeremy Taylor was found spread 
over the bottom of the box Sezley looked into it 
“Sermons,” he said “Prayers A Life of Jesus ” 

“Read it,” Lewis said 
“Read it?” 

“Where your left thumb is ”

Sezley read, kneeling on the floor 
“ ‘ and whatsoever is good, if it be a grace, it is an 
act of faith, if it be a reward, it is the fruit of faith So that 
as all the actions of man are but the productions of the 
soul, so are all the actions of the new man the effects of 
faith’ I say, shall I go on?” Then suddenly “What 
about shelves? There aren’t any ” 



CHAPTER THREE 

Sometimes a group of officers made voluntary and escorted 
marches into the countryside that lay about the fort 
Ballater went always, because confinement tormented him, 
Ferrard went “to get to know the country,” carrying a 
notebook furtively m his pocket and a miniature compass 
in the palm of his hand, Jedwell went, none knew why, foi 
he did not enjoy going But Sezley, who enjoyed every- 
thing, enjoyed this If he was walking ahead, he would 
remember that he must speak instantly to Ferrard in the 
rear, if he himself had fallen behind, it became at once 
necessary to communicate with Dacres m front He ran 
continually up and down 

“That boy,” said Jedwell, “makes one feel like an old 
ram bothered by a sheep-dog puppy ” 

Lewis, urged by Ballater to join m these marches, soon 
discovered that Jedwell was unable to communicate what 
he knew, or had known, of Hindu philosophy He began 
hopefully but his mind wandered, he would lose himself 
m anecdotes, nothing for him was clear Or being launched 
m exposition, he would be seized by a paralysis of language, 
by some obscure embarrassment at hearing his own bps 
speak these things and his own voice yield agam to the 
emotion of them, and he would become once more the 
half-humorous, half-crusty little man, ridden by whisky 
and quinine, that he appeared to be Soon he abandoned 
his vain attempts, but he and Lewis had formed a habit 
of walking side by side and did not break it, their silences 
serving them perhaps as well as words could have done 
Lewis saw that snowdrops were blooming in the gardens,

they were planted m grass and seemed to be larger, more 
starlike, less timid flowers than at home, and an hour later, 
under a sky threatening one of the showers of snow that 
were common m those early days of March, the grass 
seemed to be lighted from within and the white flowers to 
be ghostly shadows upon it 

When the march was over and the group was breaking 
up m the courtyard, Jedwell cleared his throat and said 
“Where do you work, Alison?” 

“Where I can, sir There’s generally some room fairly 
empty, according to what people are doing — the smoking- 
room or the messroom or B Three And the ramparts 
when I’m not making too elaborate notes In a few weeks 
it won’t be so cold out of doors ” 

“Ever seen my room?” 

“No, sir ” 

“Care to look? It’s not much of a place But it has a 
lock ” 

They inspected it together Its breadth was scarcely 
greater than that of its window, its length, containing the 
door and the bed, could be covered in four paces A chair, 
a table, a trunk, an iron washstand, and a row of pegs 
made up its furniture On the table, m a silver frame em- 
bossed with the heads of Reynolds’s angels, was an en- 
larged snapshot of two figures, an Indian girl looked back 
over her shoulder at Jedwell, who disregarded her On the 
wall was pinned a great map of the Western Front 

“I keep it up to date,” Jedwell said “I like to move 
the pms and wools according to the bulletins But it isn’t 
up to date,” he added fretfully “Not nearly The names 
are so difficult Once I get wrong, I never seem to get 
right again ” He straddled the chair and set an empty pipe 
between his teeth “Well, there’s the room if it’s of any 
use to you It’s not quiet Nothing is Ballater’s making a 
garden patch outside the window, he talks about it, you 
might think it was Kew And you’ll hear Sezley’s voice 
through the partition Makes me feel like the infant Samuel 
But there it is I use it only to sleep m ” 

“But you’ll want it m the evenings?” 



26

“No I play picquet with Grove m the evenings You 
can pay me rent if you like Pay it in kind Keep the map 
up to date for me Make that your job ” He rose, stared 
at the map, uprooted a pm and allowed a bight of green 
wool to drop over the bedrail Suddenly, m an outburst 
of irritation, he dragged all the wool into his hands, it hung 
from him, the pms glistening “You start afresh I can’t 
do anything right these days ” Then, m his old voice, prim 
and regulated, he said “You can turn the lady face down- 
wards if she disturbs the contemplative life Though 
she knew a bit about it ” And he added, as though an- 
swering a question “She died at Benares When you’ve 
done, you might stand her up again And do you mind not 
smoking m here? I never smoke where I sleep ” 

In the weeks that followed, Lewis was happy as he had 
not been since childhood It seemed that the world had 
indeed ceased its concern with him 

Day after day, reading at JedwelPs table or watching 
from the ramparts winter’s stubborn decline, he allowed 
the idea of his own book to grow unforced within him He 
was not impatient, for the history was not to him an end 
m itself but the symbol of a way of life, a means of dis- 
ciplining and co-ordinating it The completed work did 
not appear as a prize that should urge him to present 
anxiety but as the labour of the man he must study to be- 
come, and the end, being so far off, seemed scarcely to be 
of this world 

The form of the book must be historical, following the 
development of spiritual concepts m England since the 
Renaissance and relating them with the philosophies of a 
remoter past, but the task before him was not to give an 
account of certain mystical thinkers and even less to com- 
pose a religious history To identify the contemplative with 
the mystical purpose would be to identify a mountain with 
one of the many streams that sprang from it His care was 
to ask whether there was not a perceptible unity of all 
- the higher endeavours of the human mind, whether Plato’s 
purpose was not linked more closely than was commonly

understood with that of Aquinas, and Vaughan’s with 
Newton’s If this unity existed, what was its nature? Was 
it limited to men of genius? What was its significance in 
the lives of men and women not knowingly of the con- 
templative sort? 

Pressing upon him, as though it were an external force 
and not the product of his own argument, was the thought 
that, though the contemplative life was rare, the contem- 
plative desire was universal, being, m the spirit, what the 
sexual desire is in the flesh, the prime mover of mankind 
Contemplative stillness, he said, is but the name for a state 
of invulnerability, and to be invulnerable is what all men 
desire Even the desire for immortality, springing from fear 
of death and having its fruit m the doctrine of the resur- 
rection, is less than the desire to be invulnerable, being 
part of it The desire for immortality can never be flawless, 
it is streaked with a longing for rest, for annihilation, or 
with Hamlet’s terror of immortal dreams But the desire 
to be invulnerable is flawless, it is consistent with man’s 
longing for rest and with his eagerness for life — it is, in- 
deed, the only reconciler of them, and it implies a supre- 
macy even over dreams 

Newton seeking a final order m external Nature, the 
saints of the early Church, striving to identify themselves 
with God and to lose themselves m Him, the philosophers 
who, having no thought of resurrection, devoted their lives 
to the quest of absolute truth, the untouchable, the time- 
less thing — were not all these struggling by different paths 
towards one end, an ecstasy invulnerable because it is “out 
of the senses”? Men of a different temper, he added, pursue 
the same quest m the senses — m the apprehension of speed 
which, while it lasts, excludes the apprehension of time, 
m the arts, themselves sensual, from which they that have 
the gifts of the spirit proceed to the core of the spirit, m 
love that builds its citadel m the midst of the city, m lust 
even — that bliss of nakedness which, like a torch m the 
night, drives darkness back and, in the same instant, blinds 
the beholder to all but itself To enter by some means into 
a condition that excludes all but itself is every man’s pur-

pose He will snatch at the promise of even a ghost of that 
condition, his pleasures, his loves on earth, his art, his 
philosophy are valuable to him m proportion to the strength 
of that promise contained m them He will lose the world 
for love because m his heart he wishes to lose the world, 
to shake it off, to armour himself m an ecstasy against it 
He sees all things moving about him, he sees all conscious- 
ness in flux, he desires, if it be but for an instant, to be as 
the gods are, to be invulnerable, to be still 
And Lewis, feeling as a traveller feels who comes sud- 
denly upon a limitless prospect when he has believed 
himself to be enclosed m a narrow pass, began to think of 
contemplation, not as the exceptional province of genius, 
but as the crown of all men's hopes — a condition of vital 

E eace, he said, that carries the everlasting within it, and 
e returned to the Plato before him, hearing in it now, not 
the speech of one man only, but the argument of mankind 

When short leave on parole began to be granted to those 
who applied for it, he did not apply, and an invitation that 
he received from a Dutch lady whom he had known long 
ago m England was refused He would not be turned from 
his work Having experience sometimes of that brilliant 
lightness of spirit which is the reward of prolonged medi- 
tation, he found pleasure even m the weariness that 
followed a day's labour, and would he awake m his dormi- 
tory, hearing the slow, rasping breath of those who slept 
there and feeling that his own presence among them was 
unsubstantial, that his life m his mother’s home at Chep- 
pmg and all the world's claims upon him had been wiped 
away, that he was indeed shedding his old individuality — 
'like the skin of a snake” — and being made anew These 
passages of delight were swiftly followed by knowledge 
that they were delusions Between sleeping and waking 
the fort would appear to him to be a dream, and he 
would lie still, ridden by that hot anguish of disappoint- 
ment which is the trickery of happy dreams 
But it is no dream, his heart cried suddenly To- 
morrow, during the morning, he would work again m

Jedwell’s room or, if the wind dropped, under the elms, 
sheltered by a scoop of the ground, pausing to gaze up 
through their branches at the sky, aswirl with ribbons of 
cloud Two ravens were building, he remembered, the 
sun armoured them m gold when they moved Over the 
rookery, kestrel were active, and, though the grey-backed 
crows chased them continually, they returned again and 
again Everywhere, m defiance of gusts of snow, life was 
being renewed Primrose and daffodil were out, and the 
air at noon would be fresh and warm with a taste of flowers 
m it 

On the opposite bank, he thought, staring into the 
darkness over his bed, larks will be singing, and it may be 
that by to-morrow morning the cattle will be m the fields 
As he lay with a rough sheet dragged under his chm, 
imagining the long, gentle course of the succeeding day, 
the red and green wools and the shifting battle-fronts 
became entangled with the discourse of Timaeus, and, 
spent m thought, he sighed with the tranquillity of passion 
appeased, and, turning on his pillow, slept until morning 

As April passed, and French’s dispatches on Neuve 
Chapelle appeared m the papers from home, and kingcups 
came out on the island in the moat, Lewis began to go on 
to the ramparts later m the day There was delight, not 
only m his study of Plato, but m emerging from it — a 
blessed knowledge that he might return when he would, 
and that, though books were left behind, their wisdom 
would accompany him and maintain a ghostly world about 
him, glowing m his spirit as the memory of a summer’s 
day continues though darkness fall Even material things 
were affected in his sight by this afterglow of meditation 
They appeared now m a special calm, always at a little 
remove from himself, and when, m the evenings before 
dinner, he went out eager for company after many hours 
of silence, the earth seemed to be newly revealed to him, 
as it had been long ago when for the first time the Odyssey 
changed in his mind from words into music 

The brown sail of a barge, whose hull was concealed 
by the deep canal-banks, would rise out of the meadows

and dwell long in the great landscape, seeming to have 
fallen asleep m anticipation of dusk, and always, out of 
the glazing of the sun, a tram appeared Its wreaths of 
smoke drooped into the canals and vanished, as if the 
earth had sucked them down From the windows, heads 
were thrust out and handkerchiefs waved — always, it 
seemed, the same heads, the same handkerchiefs The 
regularity of that little tram linked day with day Time 
had forgotten this everlasting scene All that Lewis saw 
was endowed with wonder and grace, as if whatever was 
evil m the world had been emptied from it 

His delight was sharpened by the peril of all delight, a 
voice within him saying “If this should be taken from 
met” And he held these enraptured evenings jealously in 
his heart, scarcely knowing whether it was m bliss he 
trembled or in his prescience that the world would rob 
him of it A thick hedgerow pressed against the fence that 
separated the path on which he walked from the inward 
slope of the rampart, and at last the spring so abundantly 
increased m it that the great internal square of the fort, 
where the Dutch garrison had their quarters and tennis 
courts were being laid down, could hardly be seen through 
the palings and the foliage, and he looked outward as he 
made his circuits, seeing how the canal thirty feet below 
began to draw new and deeper colour from its reeded 
shores and how with the lengthening days the horizon 
extended The narrow path, curling to embrace the 
bastions, was overlaid by shadows of the trees that it 
encircled Each evening they cast a bluer accent on the 
earth, and the slash of gold stood higher among their 
branches 

A few officers were generally out at this hour and, 
personal routine being now firmly established, Lewis 
knew whom he might encounter Willett, who said that m 
civilian life he was a professional strong man, would hold 
the path, a coat of yellowish tweed dragged over his bulg- 
ing chest, and at his side, with head thrown back and bony 
nose uplifted, would be Gestable, padding along m rubber- 
soled shoes with the loping gait of a tall, shivering dog 



CH III 


THE FORT 


3i 

“Finished the history of the world?” Gestable would 
say, and Willett show his teeth m an amiable grin Or a 
young Harrovian, named Carroll- Blair, with sharp creases 
m his grey flannel trousers and wrists like brittle twigs, 
would draw Lewis into argument They would walk up 
and down together m the circle of a bastion, and, others 
joining them, the argument would deepen and increase, 
Lewis with delight leading it and drawing the truth out 
of his companions by challenge and prompting Nothing 
stimulated him more than this testing of himself in them, 
and men who were ordinarily timid of argument, falling 
carelessly into the group, stayed under the compulsion 
of interest, held as by a story, and, without knowing it, 
revealing themselves 

One evening early m May, Ballater, coming up as he 
often did after watering his patch of garden, found Lewis 
alone He began to speak of the agriculture of Holland, 
using it as an excuse to draw m a subject of which he was 
guilelessly fond — his uncle’s Wiltshire acres that he would 
inherit and certainly reorganise From the Ballater acres 
his way was easy to his Angevin pedigree and his un- 
varying success with women, who, it was implied, found 
an Angevm courtship irresistible Lewis gravely led him 
on until, at the peak of his gallant solemnities, perceiving 
a light in Lewis’s eye, he stopped, and rubbed his cheek, 
and pretended with disarming laughter that he had not 
expected to be believed No one so easily as Lewis could 
persuade Ballater to laugh at himself and enjoy it, and to 
no one, m consequence, did Ballater reveal so much of 
what lay beneath his boasting — a passion for Nature, for 
land, for the legend and spirit of the countryside, which 
induced m him a specialized love of Hardy and Words- 
worth and tempted him to water-colour painting desper- 
ately sincere He could be more proud of his water-colours 
than of his pedigree, but the woollmess of his trees smote 
him, and often he abandoned his brush and sought an 
outlet m the secret composition of descriptive essays, 
choked with the names of little-known grasses and flowers 

One of these essays he now brought out of his pocket

He invited Lewis, as a scholar, to criticize it “Of course/ 
he said, ‘Tm not a writer and all that, but I do know about 
curlews ” They sat down on the edge of the rampart, side 
by side Lewis was careful to criticize nothing but the 
prose of the essay, leaving its sentiment unquestioned, for 
natural history was Ballater’s religion, his knowledge of it 
was hedged about with prides and faith, and this writing 
was an oblation to his god Life m the fort marvellously 
exposed the lovable and childlike secrets of men That is 
why Ballater bears so patiently with my freak of scholar- 
ship, Lewis thought It must seem a mad waste of life to 
him But he treats me always with the smiling respect 
appropriate m country squires towards the men of letters 
they have tamed 

“Last time it rained/’ Ballater said, when the essay had 
been folded and put away, “there were no leaves on the 
trees ” He looked up at a cloudless sky, thinking, perhaps, 
of his garden “It will be good to hear the raindrops 
pattering on leaves when it does come Sounds like sum- 
mer But, as the evenings become lighter,” he added, 
turning away from Lewis and kicking his heels into the 
turf, “it will be harder to escape ” 

“Are you planning an escape?” 

“No, as a matter of fact I’m not — not yet But it worries 
me I ought to, I suppose Everyone is They sit about m 
corners making plots, but it’s a game more or less, it would 
be the devil of a shock to most of them if they found them- 
selves on the other side of the barbed wire That’s where 
the Dutch are so wily — giving us short leave on parole 
now and then It keeps people from being bored, and 
boredom’s at the bottom of most escaping stunts Aren’t 
you ever sick of this place? If it weren’t for short leave now 
and then, and my patch of garden and the birds, I’d go 
mad Why don’t you ever take leave?” 

“I have my job here,” Lewis said “Even you can’t take 
your garden to the Hague ” 

“But if we were given permanent parole — there have 
r been vague rumours of it — we could live where we liked 
in Holland You could do your history even better then 99

But life in any other part of Holland, with liberty to 
come and go and choose one's own conditions, would not 
have the mtactness of this life Here nothing moved but 
thought “In this place," Lewis said, “we eat what we are 
given, we sleep where we are told to sleep There's no 
question ‘Shall I go to the Hebrides to-morrow? Won't 
it be damnably selfish if I do this or that?' We can't go to 
the Hebrides or anywhere else — that's final There are 
no obligations, no ties Money has ceased to exist — and 
time We are living on earth but we're as independent as 
ghosts " 

“First rate/' said Ballater, “if the life of a ghost satisfies 
you But I want to ride I want more people — different 
people I want women, too — oh, not simply for the obvious 
reason It amuses me to see them and talk to them Don't 
you want that?" 

They sat for a little while without speaking, at ease m 
their own thought The evening tram appeared, the clatter 
of it came to them across the moat and died away m the 
distance 

“Can you still hear it?” Ballater said, long after it was 
gone He rose and stretched himself “We'd better go 
down They’ll be clearing the ramparts soon I hate being 
herded off by some damned corporal " 

They had begun to walk on together when they saw 
advancing towards them the figure of the Commandant — 
a strange figure, tightly encased m a dark cavalry uniform, 
high and square at the shoulders, clipped at the waist 
The head was carried at an upward tilt, like the head of a 
dog walking on its hind-legs, the breeches had the bulge 
of leg o' mutton sleeves in the 'eighties, the shanks were 
covered by patent-leather hessians that ran to sharp 
points at the toes and picked their way through an im- 
aginary mud The hands were gloved, and a tasselled 
switch hung by a loop from an extended wrist 
“At any moment/’ said Ballater, “the figure may dance " 
As he approached, the Commandant threw up both 
his hands m an exaggerated gesture of recognition and 
delight

“Ah 1 ” he said, bestriding the path and showing his 
teeth m a wide, pink smile “I have good news*” 

Their thought was instantly of the war, though they 
could not understand why the Commandant should have 
come out on the ramprrts to give them news of it 
“News? What is it, sir?” Lewis asked 
“Shall I tell you?” the Commandant exclaimed, 
warmed by their curiosity “Or shall I keep it a secret? 
Friday morning will, perhaps, be soon enough Will you 
do me the honour to take luncheon with me on Friday? 
And you also, Mr Ballater? You also have an eye for 
ladies, I am told Ah yes, little rumours creep up from 
the Hague of how when Mr Ballater goes on leave — but 
it is not you who are the conqueror on this occasion, Mr 
Ballater ” 

Lewis said “Have you yourself made a conquest, sir?” 
The Commandant smiled his youngest smile and 
touched his grey hair “Alas, I am old as you see — but 
perhaps not so old that — well, we shall see, we shall see ” 
Then, leaning forward, he laid a forefinger along the side 
of his nose, in the manner of certain Dutchmen when they 
are coy “No, it is you who have conquered, Mr Alison 
You, who refuse always to take leave You will not go to 
the ladies So the ladies they come to you Can you guess? 
I will give you a hint It is a very great lady ” 

“Oh,” said Ballater, “do you mean that the Queen of 
Holland is to visit the fort? There was a rumour of it some 
time ago I thought it was nonsense ” 

The Commandant laughed aloud It was evident that 
his news, whatever it might be, had given him extreme 
pleasure “No Not the Queen, Mr Ballater Guess again 
One more hint A lady whose husband belongs to a 
very ancient, noble family But there, you will never 
guess How could you? I never dreamed of such a thing 
myself I will tell you ” His voice changed to solemnity 
Taking Lewis and Ballater by the arm, he drew them 
on towards the gate that led down from the ramparts “I 
-have had orders from the Ministry of War to prepare to 
receive the Baron and the Baroness van Leyden on Friday 



CH III

35 

— Leyden van Enkendael, you understand They happen 
to be sleeping on Thursday at Utrecht They will arrive 
Friday at 12 50 And why are they coming you ask? To 
visit our fortifications? — no To visit me ? — och 1 ” He 
threw out his hands “It is to visit Mr Alison they come ” 

Ballater, who never blushed to say those things that 
earned for him more leave than was given to any other 
officer m the fort, said “But they would scarcely be 
coming, would they, sir, if anyone but yourself were com- 
manding the fort?” 

“You think so?” the Commandant replied thoughtfully 
“Well, I did know Leyden a little when I was a young 
man It is true that m our army all the officers are not of 
the nobility However ” He clapped his hands together 
“So that is arranged? Our little luncheon party? There will 
be one lady only — Mevrou w van Leyden herself Y our friend 
is a sly dog, Mr Ballater Even now he does not tell us 
how he came to know the van Leydens And I hear — un- 
officially, of course — that he refused an invitation to Enken- 
daal 1 The Minister inquired whether I had refused him 
leave and if so ” 

“The explanation’s simple enough, sir I don’t really 
know the van Leydens at all But the Baroness’s first hus- 
band was an Englishman ” 

“I remember A relative of the Marquess of Harbury?” 

“He was a writer,” Lewis continued “My father pub- 
lished his books Our home happens to be on the outskirts 
of Harbury Park That’s all I knew the Baroness as Mrs 
Quillan ” 

“And her beautiful English daughter no doubt?” 

“She was a child ” 

“But even now, Mr Ballater, you notice your friend 
does not tell us why he refused an invitation to Enkendaal ” 

“I was settled here, sir ” 

The Commandant smiled knowingly “Shy? But they 
are very simple people,” he said, adding with a glint of 
malice “Indeed, Mevrouw van Leyden has no reason to

name, but the old Dutch, Enkendael , is retained m the family’s title

Mr Ballater? She was governess at Enkendaal twenty-five 
years ago, beautiful but of no family Then she married the 
Englishman, Quillan Leyden never lost touch with 1 or 
He used to visit at Lord Harbury’s whenever he went to 
England — calling at the house of Mr Quillan, you may be 
sure ” He chuckled and stroked his cheek “And when 
Leyden became a widower, it wasn’t long before the lady 
was back m Enkendaal But they are charming Charm- 
ing We should not have refused, Mr Ballater, I think? 
To stay m the country with beautiful ladies? Better than 
the fort, met waar 

“Who are these people?” Ballater asked, when the Com- 
mandant had returned to his own quarters, waving his 
hand like a schoolgirl m high spirits “Why are they com- 
ing here?” 

“Just in kindness,” Lewis answered “To visit prisoners 
and captives ” 

Ballater smiled “And the girl — the daughter — what’s 
her name?” 

“Julie Quillan Grafin von Narwitz, now ” 

“Did you know her well?” 

“Yes, once I was ten years older than she An unofficial 
tutor, more or less, until her mother ran away to Holland ” 

“Really beautiful?” 

Lewis hesitated “I think of her as a child She did come 
to England three years ago when her father was dying 
She must have been eighteen I saw her for a moment at 
the funeral, but scarcely to speak to In some odd way 
she didn’t seem the same person ♦ . But yes, really 
beautiful ” 

“Is she coming, do you think?” 

“Probably not The Commandant said van Leyden 
and his wife Julie may not be m Utrecht Anyhow, it was 
probably thought that a girl who married a Prussian officer 
three months before the war couldn’t be a visitor here ” 

“But she’s English ” 

“She was ” 

“Anyhow,” Ballater said, “it ought to be an amusing

party The Commandant flourishing his nobility You’ll 

have to give your Plato a rest on Friday afternoon ” 

The first dinner-bell was ringing and officers were mov- 
ing across the courtyard on their way to the messroom 
“Look,” Ballater exclaimed, “Ferrard and Gestable 
prospecting again ” 

“Prospecting? For what?” 

“Escape D’you think they’ll ever do it?” he added 
to Hernot, who had come up at Lewis’s side Hernot threw 
a glance over his shoulder at Ferrard 
“No,” he said “They’re non-starters They talk too 
much This escaping business is becoming a disease with 
some people,” he went on, taking Lewis’s arm as they 
moved off towards the messroom 

“All the same,” Ballater put m, “I suppose it is our job 
to get out if we can ” 

Hernot turned on him with a sneer “I dare say it is 
for those that haven’t a mind of their own But I scheme 
to get out because I personally want to get out — not be- 
cause my country needs me Flying happens to be my job 
and I can’t do it here But if my job were to study Plato, 
I’d study Plato and be thankful These boys intent on be- 
ing heroes with wire-cutters sent out to them m cakes — 
it’s all cant, though they don’t know it There are only 
two ways out of this place, anyhow, and they’ll never use 
either of them ” 

“What are the two ways?” Ballater asked 
“One is to bribe the whole guard on the bridge You 
need money for that — more than I’ve got There’s one 
other way ” 

“Do you know it?” 

“I do, but I’m not ready ” Suddenly, with a pressure 
of his arm, Hernot drew Lewis out of the little stream of 
men wandering m to dme “Look here, Alison,” he said 
“After the war, let’s meet I may be through with flying 
then ” He put his foot on a wooden bench that stood out- 
side the messroom, and smoothed out a piece of paper 
on his knee “I shall get out, and I’ll tell you how Read r 
that ”

In the fading light, Lewis saw that the paper put into 
his hands was the printed form, issued m the Com- 
mandant’s office, that each Englishman was required to 
sign before taking short-leave on parole

assist others to escape

“Well,” Lewis said, “how does that help you?” 

“Read it again,” Hernot answered quietly, “omitting 
the first ‘not ’ I have a facsimile, all but the one word, 
coming from England — same paper, same print When it 
comes, I put in for a week-end m the Hague When the 
day comes, up I go to the Commandant’s office, he gives 
me one of his own forms to sign, I pick up a pen and ask 
him about the weather While he looks out of the window, 
I pocket his form and sign my own T hope you have a 
good time m the Hague, Mr Hernot ’ ‘Thank you, sir ’ 
And off I go, report in the Hague, shift to Rotterdam I 
shall be home before they miss me ” 

“They’ll ask the War Office to send you back ” 

“And d’you suppose the War Office will send back a 
pilot for the sake of a quibble? They want me, the Dutch 
don’t Once in England, I’m safe enough And when I’m 
gone, no one will ever get out of this place again I’m glad 
for your sake Why should you escape? It’s not a question

You can do your own job m peace ”

The bell was ringing again and they went into the mess- 
room together After dinner, the poker players settled to 
their game The chink of beans m their saucer was answered 
by the swirl, the rattle, the drop of a roulette ball Outside 
the messroom, Lewis found men walking up and down 
m pairs, between the buildings and the barbed wire The 
name of the Lusitania recurred again and again, but some- 
times they were silent as they passed, guarding, he thought, 
a secret of escape Sometimes it was of swimming they 
spoke, or of the hard tennis courts that the Government 
had laid down, often of women, of theatres in London, of 
good wine, good food Jerram, who might be seen each 
mormng, seated at a desk, preparing himself to become 
an actuary, walked under the arc-lights, discoursing m a 
raven’s voice of the philosophy of mathematics And the 
arc-lights, shedding their glare on the barbed wire and the 
silver gravel and the burdock at the water’s edge, drawing 
an intense blackness out of the little branch-canal that 
separated the living-quarters from the great mass of the 
ramparts, awakening m the ramparts themselves a harsh 
green sliced by metallic shadows, blotted out the sky and 
enclosed all life within the compass of a stage whereon 
these figures went to and fro continually m a wheeling 
pattern of flash and gloom 

Lewis, having taken his fill of the night air, went on to 
his dormitory Here, so early m the evening, he could 
generally be alone To-night Lapham and Shordey and 
Willett, seated on trunks round an upturned sugar-box, 
were playmg a game of their own that they called poor 
man’s poker When he was undressed, their game broke 
up They gathered round his bed, on which he had propped 
himself — a book across his knees 

“Look here, Alison,” Willett said, “I don’t want to 
interrupt you, but there’s something we should like to have 
your opimon about The point is this Ferrard and Gestable 
and I planned an escape together Bribery was part of it, 
it meant money, I’ve tried to raise my share Well, I’m a 
kind of showman m private life — strong man and so forth 
— and I’m poor, I have to send money home, I can’t raise

my share of the bribe and the outside expenses of a car to 
Rotterdam and all that ” 

“And we’re poor, too, Shordey and me,” Lapham put 
m “We and Willett rows in the same boat That’s how 

it is And we thought that if you, Alison ” 

“Let me,” said Willett “ The point is that if a dozen 
and more run a scheme it won’t cost more than for one or 
two Divided up, it’ll come cheap There are lots of poor 
men m the fort Alone they can’t do much, but bring them 
together and it might be a damned fine show ” 

“I see,” Lewis answered 

“My idea is a tunnel,” Willett continued “It would 
take the hell of a time and there are all sorts of difficulties, 
but the chief one that I can see is keeping the people 
together You know how everyone goes his own way m 
this place, we’re a howling democracy Lapham and 
Shordey and I will do the dog- work What we want you 
to do is to be the brains behind the thing You give the 
orders We’ll see they’re carried out ” 

“The long an’ the short of it is,” said Lapham, “that 
the scheme wants officering Me an’ Shordey and Willett’s 

been bickerin’ about it already If you came m ” 

“But why me?” Lewis asked 

“To start with, you’re not mixed up in any of the private 
stunts,” Willett replied “And it was you who hit on the 
one idea that gives Ferrard’s scheme the least chance of 
coming off Anyhow, people will listen to you who won’t 
listen to any of us ” 

“Why should they?” 

“Because you’ve a mind and they know it And you 
don’t shout and get worked up You wouldn’t come m on 
a thing of this kind unless you meant to go through with it 
That’s why ” 

“In this place, you know,” Lewis said, “I haven’t laid 
myself out to be a man of action ” 

Willett was not to be shaken “That’s why, too The 
place simply rattles with men of action There’s a Dead- 
Eye Dick in every corner I’m sick to death of ’em And 
they’re sick of themselves ”

Lewis glanced at the book lying open on his bed, the 
point of his finger was still marking the line at which he 
had ceased to read Then he looked up into Willett’s eager 
face — a blunt-featured, honest, attractive face with eyes 
slow but bright, hair thinning at the temples, and a mouth 
good-humoured and firm I shall be in the thick of it, 
Lewis thought 

Willett sat down on a chair beside the bed “I don’t 
pretend to be anything of a scholar,” he began, “but I 
respect other people’s jobs — if they’re genuine I don’t 
understand what you’re driving at, Alison — I mean the 
way you live here — but I’ll lay what you’re doing’s worth 
doing I don’t want to hedge you into running this poor 
man’s scheme Some of the people in this place are just 
shirkers — too damned lazy to stir hand or foot If we want 
them to dig, we’ll rope ’em in They won’t stand up 
against public opinion They’ll come and be heroes be- 
cause that way’s easier — you see if they won’t But if you 
feel that your job’s to stand clear — well, that’s that But 
I’ll say this until we actually get out, the thing oughtn’t 
to trouble you much We shan’t be able to dig for more 
than a few hours a day — perhaps only for a few hours a 
week You’ll have time for your own work, too ” 

“It’s not a question of time,” Lewis said 

“What then?” 

“It’s a question of how your mind runs — clear, or 
silted up with other things There are some jobs that can’t 
be done with half your mind — starting and stopping, like 
a bus-horse ” 

“I see Then you’d rather we hadn’t asked you?” 

“Yes,” Lewis answered “I wish to God you hadn’t 
But since you have, I’ll do it — if in the end it’s necessary 
But it’s up to you to sound other people You’ve got to get 
the team together They may not want it — or may not 
want me ” 

“Give us a fortnight or three weeks,” Willett said 
“There are some useful people on leave We’ll have to 
wait until they come back Then we’ll ask you again It 
may come to nothing ”

“Very well,” Lewis replied, picking up his book 

In his thought of the van Leydens, in Herriot’s plan 
of escape, m this scheme of Willett’s, the world had 
approached Lewis through the swerving of his own mind, 
but it receded again To-morrow he would be undis- 
turbed To-morrow and for many to-morrows he might 
be at peace “It may come to nothing,” Willett had said, 
and he forgot Willett and the Commandant’s luncheon 
party, he shut them away from him Outside, the wind 
was rising When at last the groups m the messroom 
broke up and flooded the dormitory with talk of Atlantic 
transport and Jerram’s straight flush to a knave, he thought 
of the canals ruffled in the darkness and of the sentries 
on the ramparts bending their heads to the wind If the 
breeze increased, the barbed wire would sing with it 

During the night he heard often the twang of wire on 
the stakes, heard it until its shrill vibration and the slow 
lash of the risen wind became an unperceived accom- 
paniment to silence On a little table at his bedside he had 
built, as was his custom, a shelter of books for his candle, 
so that the light disturbed none of the sleepers but fell on 
his book and hands 

The storm ran its course and died away Now and then 
the regular breathing of the dormitory was broken by the 
creak of springs and the gasp or muffled cry of a dream 
The Dutch sergeant, on his rounds, standmg m the door- 
way with a shaded lamp, stared at the lighted head and 
shoulders of the reader, not m surprise, for Lewis’s night- 
watch was familiar to him, but as children stare at a 
picture that disturbs them, they know not why Some- 
times the Englishman was not reading, though his book 
was open, and the sergeant, encountering the wide eyes 
that included him in their gaze but seemed not to recog- 
nize his presence, was fascinated by the origins of a vision 
that he could not share He shaded his lamp the more 
carefully and, going at last, quietened his tread, not wish- 
ing to be long a solitary witness of this struggle or to in- 
fringe this isolated power But he returned again, drawn 
by a curiosity stronger than his reluctance, and at his

third visit, when the morning light was clinging like a 
mist to the edges of the bhnds, he found the candle out, 
the shelter of books laid down and Lewis asleep with one 
hand fallen from the coverlet and the other curled above 
his head 



CHAPTER FOUR 


“Sweet vernal is over, and nearly all the ewes have 
lambed,” Ballater was saying, as he and Lewis went to- 
gether into the Commandant’s quarters, whither the van 
Leydens had already been taken “I think it’s the best 
moment of the year Hot days and cold evenings Better 
than April Much better than June ” He had a pastoral 
independence of mind Though he would earnestly discuss 
politics and the war, they were not in the core of his 
thought Like a peasant, like a child, he preserved his own 
values with a stubborn and lovable innocence And it was he 
who smoothed away the awkwardness of the van Leyden’s 
visit, for after luncheon he permitted neither Lewis nor 
the Commandant to be their host, but showed them the 
fort, as if it were his country-house, with an irresistible 
pride of ownership, telling them of his fishing, his jay, his 
golden oriole in the orchard opposite, explaining the work 
he had done m his garden patch, and, when he heard a 
reed warbler merrily singing across the water, waving 
their attention to it, as if it were a member of an orchestra 
that he had summoned for the pleasure of his guests The 
Baroness, after a cold beginning, was full of praise for 
Ballater when she heard of the Wiltshire acres “What a 
charming friend you have, Lewis* You must bring him 
to stay with us Or, if you will not come, then he must 
come alone ” And van Leyden, delighted to find m Lewis 
an Englishman who could speak Dutch, talked proudly 
of his library in the Castle at Enkendaal “You must come 
to see it It would interest you, Mr Alison He can have 
permission, Commandant, met waar?” 



CH IV 


THE FORT

“But certainly he can have permission to visit the Castle 
at Enkendaal,” the Commandant replied The words 
Enkendaal and Kasteel fascinated him, he could no more 
keep them out of his conversation than he could prevent 
his corseted body from inclining a little whenever the 
Baron van Leyden addressed him “But Mr Alison,” he 
added, “has always refused to take leave ” 

“Och 1 ” said the Baron “How is that? Julie says you 
taught her when she was a child I wish you’d teach her 
again She needs discipline, heaven knows * But, 
though I’m not a scholar, I know their ways My uncle 
Dirk would never leave his books unless it suited him 
Invite yourself when you please ” 

The idea of having a pupil, a mind that he might 
impregnate, filled Lewis with excitement Into his con- 
versation with the Baroness this excitement entered He 
laughed with her, and pleased her more than he had done 
hitherto, but he was thinking that, m the days when he 
had gone to Natton Lodge to teach Julie, Mrs Quillan 
had appeared to be heavy and dull, with the beauty of a 
stiff flower always drooping towards him on its long stem, 
and that the child, full of fire and grace, had never seemed 
to be her daughter 

“You did not bring the beautiful Madame de Narwitz 
to-day?” the Commandant ventured, hoping that this 
compliment would recommend him to Julie’s mother 
“No, no, of course,” he added hastily, seeing a shadow 
pass across the Baroness’s face “It would be difficult 
I understand ” 

“No,” said the Baroness, with sharpness m her tone 
Then, turning to Lewis “She wished to come She 
wanted, she said, to see her schoolmaster m his cage ” 

At this the Commandant laughed heartily, wrinkling his 
lips under his clipped, white moustache, pressing his gloved 
hands to his waist and throwmgback his head The Baroness 
stared at him coolly for a moment, then turned away 

It was understood before the van Leydens went that 
Ballater was to visit them early m June Meanwhile, the

tranquil routine of the fort continued unbroken Willett 
said no more of his project and Lewis imagined that it 
was postponed, then ceased to think of it Herriot made 
no move 

One evening at dinner Herriot leaned across the table 
and poured wine into Lewis’s glass They had so often 
shared their wine that Lewis gave no more acknowledge- 
ment than a movement of his hand, the talk was not 
interrupted Ballater announced that he had been sowing 
radishes, Jedwell didn’t believe that the advance of the 
Allies near La Bassee could be maintained Lewis con- 
tinued a conversation with the Dutch captain 

“Anything you want from the Hague?” Herriot broke 
m “I’m going on leave to-morrow ” Lewis understood 
then that the wme in their glasses had that night a special 
significance, it was the last they would drink together, for 
Herriot would not return from the Hague, and he was 
sad, as though this were an old friend he was losing The 
day became suddenly memorable and he cast his mind 
back over it, remembering how Ballater had given him a 
pair of field-glasses with which to observe the movements 
of a reed warbler on the farther side of the moat, and how, 
while he stood with the glasses to his eyes, a little group 
had assembled behind him, eagerly discussing the resig- 
nations of Fisher and Churchill The edge of the moat 
was deeply fringed with yellow iris, ablaze m the sun, and 
apple blossom was coming out 

These fragmentary details, by which alone day was 
divided from day, persisted m ms imagination while he 
walked with Herriot in the courtyard after dinner He 
could not free himself from the thought that they would 
never see each other again, or would meet as strangers, 
their intimacy lost. After the war, if both survived, they 
would speak of to-night — this walking up and down 
together, their unconfessed reluctance to separate, the 
little incident of the wme, and would struggle to recapture 
the vanished mood But they would fail, and, after a few 
hours of friendly pretence, part, leaving over their next 
meeting an intentional vagueness

Never before had he been so strongly aware that m 
each instant of their lives men die to that instant It is not 
time that passes away from them but they who recede 
from the constancy, the immutability of time, so that 
when afterwards they look back upon themselves it is not 
themselves they see, not even — as it is customary to say — 
themselves as they formerly were, but strange ghosts made 
m their image, with whom they have no communication 
He heard Herriot saying “D’you know, Alison, this 
ache of mine to fly — I lose trust in it sometimes, just as 
you lose trust m your own job Often one flies just for the 
excitement of speed and power, but that’s nothing Any 
fool of a passenger gets it — it’s little more than a physical 
thrill I want to fly for the sake of the flash of seeing that 
comes now and then — almost as if one died bodily, and 
escaped from oneself, and saw out on the other side But 
I can’t tell you what it is I see I can’t even remember it 
myself It will be the same with you Some day the kind of 
exaltation you told me of, that comes to you after days 
and days of thought, will suddenly become more than it 
has ever been before — and you will see Then you’ll come 
back, just as I come back to earth, and you won’t be able 
to tell what you’ve seen — or remember it But the thing 
you can’t describe and can’t remember will be the whole 
of life to you Sometimes you’ll call it God, and sometimes 
you’ll feel that it’s nothingness and that you’ve given up 
your life to nothingness And m what way you’ll reach 
it, I don’t know Maybe through solitude I doubt it I 
believe you’ll find what you’re looking for in the world, 
not m withdrawing from it Work, women, responsibility 
— you’ll have to accept them and go through with them ” 
“If you’re right,” Lewis said, “after all this — and after 
I’ve learned from this — I shall have to start again ” 

They walked in silence beyond the courtyard, down the 
length of the buildings The windows of the messroom 
threw patches of yellow light on to the small brick of the 
path, drawing a plum-like bloom out of its redness “We’d 
better put m an appearance,” Lewis said “The Dutch 
will think you’re conspiring ” They entered the room and

stood, propped by the wall, at a little distance from the 
roulette players 

“It’s odd,” Herriot said, shaking dead pipe-ash into his 
hand, “how our heavens seem to differ and yet are alike 
I reach mine, as much of it as I shall ever reach, by going 
m a machine up into the air But I’m a little man You 
may become what I can never be — the invulnerable man, 
passed beyond harm I can never be that But our ideas 
come out of the same basket — or seem to to-night Perhaps 
they won’t again ” 

Half an hour later the roulette cloth was rolled up and 
they went to their dormitories amid a little group talking 
of systems 

In the morning Herriot went on leave and did not re- 
appear The arguments provoked by his escape soon died, 
but the community was affected Already, by grants of 
short leave, the character of internment had been changed, 
now restlessness increased, perhaps, it was said, perma- 
nent parole would be given Preparations for tunnel- 
diggmg were continued by those who had no desire for 
parole or, desiring it, were without faith m diplomats, and 
Ballater, having flattered the Commandant into taking a 
benevolent interest in gardens, proudly imported a spade 
Rampart and messroom and dormitory were eager with 
rumour from the Hague The fort had ceased to include 
the lives of its inhabitants 

After his visit to Enkendaal, Ballater returned to the 
fort at midnight To his disappointment, Lewis was 
already asleep, and he was forced to turn in with his 
triumphs untold In the morning he fared no better He 
loitered in the messroom after breakfast, discussing with 
Ferrard, who was annoyingly stubborn and would not 
give way, whether a carp should properly be cooked m 
milk, and when he had despaired of Ferrard, he found 
that Lewis was already inaccessible m JedwelPs room He 
had therefore to content himself with the silent planting 
out of candytuft He pulled a few radishes, intending to 
pull only a few, but, he thought, if I pull them all at once 



ch iv THE FORT 49 

there’ll be enough to go round the mess This would win 
fame for his garden, and the prospect of it was his con- 
solation m an unprofitable hunt for a mole 

“Pretty good crop of radishes, sir,” he cried as Jedwell 
passed 

“Ah, Ballater, still at your garden,” was the reply, given 
without a turning of the head 

Perhaps Jedwell had not heard Ballater stared at the 
back of the little man’s skull and at his ribbed neck But 
he’ll be glad enough to eat them, he thought, returning 
to his quest of the mole 

His afternoon was more fortunate For once, he had no 
need to persuade Lewis to be idle Lewis himself suggested 
that they should play tennis, and, when tennis was done, 
they fetched towels from the dormitory and went down 
to the landing-stage on the edge of the western ramparts 
They swam and lay m the sun and swam again “Hot 1 ” 
Ballater said 

He was waiting, had long been waiting, to be asked his 
news of Enkendaal, but Lewis appeared to have forgotten 
that he had been there 

“You seem to be taking a day off,” Ballater said “Are 
you working to-night instead?” 

“Not to-night ” 

“What’s wrong? Are you stuck m the book?” 

Lewis stretched his bare arms across the grass “No I 
read pretty steadily this morning But this place has 
changed And I’ve got the tunnel on my mind Where to 
begin How to begin How to get through the floor — 
there’s concrete, you know, under the wood ” 

“Oh, to hell with the tunnel,” Ballater answered “Too 
much like work on a day like this I’m warm and dry 
already And, anyhow, I believe we shall be given parole 
before the tunnel’s through If we’re not, and the tunnel’s 
discovered or fails m some way, it will give the German 
Legation an excuse to have parole washed out and leave 
stopped This place isn’t so bad if you can get leave now 
and then But I don’t want to spend another winter here 
The tunnel’s more nsk than it’s worth ”

So 

“But you’re in on it?” 

“Of course I am You can’t say No to a thing like that 
You came in on it yourself I did because you did Run 
by Willett and Shordey and Lapham, it would have been 
hopeless Now at least there’s a sporting chance, though it 
is a devilish poor chance, if you ask me Don’t you agree?” 
“About one to a hundred ” 

“Then we’re wasting our time?” 

“As long as we don’t realize it too acutely, I suppose it 
doesn’t matter But I should like Willett’s ‘poor men’ to 
have a run for their money ” 

Ballater turned over on his face and threw his towel 
aside 

“When we do get permanent parole,” he said, “if we 
ever do, the place I should like to live in is Enkendaal 
They were talking about it at dinner The Baron said, 
Should we like to live m Enkendaal? I thought at first he 
meant in the Castle But he meant on the estate They 
own the village and all the land for miles round Such 
country! Heath and pine We went up to a place where 
you can look out between two woods right across to the 
German frontier The Baron said if I wanted country and 
you wanted books we couldn’t do better in Holland He’d 
give you the run of his library ” 

“Did you see the library?” 

“Yes We went up there, into the tower ” 

“What kind of library is it?” 

“Enormous Great thick walls and ” 

“I mean, what kind of books?” 

“Oh 1 ” Ballater was wriggling across the grass to- 
wards his cigarette case When the first wreath of smoke 
had twined into the air, he had forgotten about books 
“You’d like the place,” he said “There are two great 
lakes at the foot of the tower — and the lilacs . I 

admired them, and Julie gave ” 

“Julie?” said Lewis 

Ballater smiled “Well, I don’t call her that to her 
face yet In fact, I don’t call her anything I can’t cadi 
a perfectly good English girl Narwitz. She doesn’t look 



CH IV 


THE FORT 


5 * 

in the least Narwitz Anyhow, she made me wear a 
sprig of lilac m my button-hole at dinner — took away my 
carnation and put the lilac m There was a man there 
called Alex van Arkel, they call him Aguecheek behind 
his back, he was furious about the lilac, because she hadn’t 
any for him I don’t like that man He wears a bracelet 
Pro-German probably And when he wants to annoy 
Julie he pretends that she must be pro-German too You 
should see the colour come into her cheeks ” 

“I liked the Baron,” Lewis said “It’s odd, I can vaguely 
remember now having met him at the Quillans’ years ago, 
but until he came to the fort I’d forgotten that I had ever 
seen him. Did you talk much to him?” 

“Shooting chiefly And agriculture of course He was 
frightfully interested when he found I really knew some- 
thing about it But you can talk to Julie about anything 
Except, I think, it’s better to keep off the war She’s on 
edge about that Not that she lets most people see it, but 
I saw it I can often see what’s going on m a girl’s mind 
And I think I was rather a relief to her because I’m 
English I wish I could do something to help her I be- 
lieve I could if I were living there ” 

“Help her?” 

“Well in the Castle everyone round her Dutch 

And every Dutchman who comes there ” Ballater 

pressed the stub of his cigarette into the earth “I don’t 
blame them, poor fools She’s beautiful enough to make 

you want to cry Do you know, once when she and I ” 

Lewis had risen to his feet “I’m going to swim again,” 
he said They walked down to the brink of the water to- 
gether, and Ballater put a watch into Lewis’s hand, saying 
that he was going to sprint across the moat 
“I used to be fast at Dartmouth You might time me 
I don’t think I’ve lost much of my speed ” 

In sixty-two seconds he touched the farther bank and 
began to return leisurely, pausing to lift a long white arm 
out of the water and to shout “How long?” Being told, he 
disappeared with a splutter of satisfaction and came up 
again with a great threshing of arms and legs As he swam, 



THE FOUNTAIN

the water ran out m a twisting spiral of gold and steel and 
foam Beyond him the countryside was red with sorrel 
and yellow with buttercups 

He stopped swimming and for a moment lay extended 
on his face, his hands dividing the calm surface before 
him, his body rippling through a little cloak of bubbles 
And Lewis remembered how he had said “She's beautiful 
enough to make you want to cry,” — an unexpected saying 
m Ballater, who now threw his shoulders out of the water 
and began to turn somersaults with a ridiculous grace, 
emerging at last breathless and m grinning expectation 
of applause Lewis was trying to imagine her, but he saw 
at first only the shadowy figure of a child known m the 
past, then, suddenly, he saw her cheek as he had seen it 
when Ballater spoke of the colour rising m it He could 
not imagine her face, but her cheek he saw and the swift 
flow of colour and the flash of the eyes, though the eyes 
themselves were unimagmed He laughed at Ballater and 
dived into the water after him 

They swam down the canal and across to the farther 
bank, visiting the reed warbler’s nest “One egg,” said 
Ballater “Now I'll race you to the boom,” and at the 
end of the race they lay on the water, exhausted, silent, 
while birds hung and arrowed in the air above them 
Inaudible waves lapped at their temples and slid over 
their ankles and wrists Without speaking they swam back 
and stretched themselves out again on the hot boards of 
the landing stage 

It was resolved that the mouth of the tunnel should be 
under Lewises bed A large boring should be carried across 
the room, and the earth from it packed handful by handful 
m the nine-inch space between wooden floor and concrete 
foundation Under the path, under the rampart and its 
barbed wire, a narrow tunnel should then be pushed 
forward to the inner edge of the moat The broader shaft 
would become a receptacle for earth from the narrower, 
the need for close, laborious packing would cease, and the 
narrow shaft, once begun, make swift progress One night, 



ch iv THE FORT 53 

perhaps m early autumn, twenty-six men would assemble 
at the moat’s brim beneath an unsuspecting sentry They 
would launch off into the water together The sentry, m 
an embarrassment of targets, would miss his aim At 
worst, twenty-four would clamber up the farther bank 
Three might get to Rotterdam, two, it was hoped, to 
England 

To turn back a flap of linoleum and hmge a trap-door 
m the floor-boarding was easy enough But how was the 
concrete to be broken^ Lewis remembered that Willett 
was by profession a strong man and that the Commandant 
was of genial disposition 

“I can’t get exercise, sir, not the right kmd of exercise,” 
Willett said Exposing his muscles, he made it clear that 
they were deteriorating, his livelihood was slipping from 
him, when the war was done, his wife and children must 
starve “Ja, ja,” said the Commandant, “I will see what 
I can think of,” but Lewis had already decided that what 
Willett needed was a heavy crowbar from the garrison 
store This was obtained Willett exercised himself with 
it conspicuously, the garrison, passing through the court- 
yard, were confirmed m their opinion that the English 
were mad, the Commandant, when he had guests, brought 
them to the window of his quarters to observe Willett’s 
behaviour They were well entertained by it 

Meanwhile two clubs were organized The Photography 
Club, under Ballater’s control, obtained permission to im- 
port oxygen, m which the Commandant saw no evil The 
Boxing Club, advertised on the messroom notice-board, 
invited the Commandant to be its Honorary President, and 
he knew at once how wrong he had been m supposing that 
the Englishmen disliked or laughed at him “There is no 
greater honour,” he said in a little speech after dinner, 
“than to be invited by your countrymen to share m their 
sport”, and for the first meeting of the Boxing Club, held 
in B Three dormitory when dinner was over, he put on 
his smartest uniform Never since his coming to the fort 
had he enjoyed himself so much The boxing itself was 
tedious, but he applauded with all his heart To accept a

few drinks, to refuse many more with a wag of his finger 
and a shake of his head, to unbend m a manner befitting 
a gentleman who knew how to preserve his dignity and 
yet be a “sport” — what could be more delightful? “To- 
night we are all sports together, isn’t?” 

“Yes, sir,” said Ferrard, lifting his glass and his eye- 
brows, “all sports together* Vive les Pay$-Bas f ” 

“ Vive les Pays-Bas f ” cned twenty-six Englishmen m 
chorus 

The Commandant rose to the toast How the English- 
men cheered* How they sang* But their taste m music was 
execrable Men of no other nation would play three gramo- 
phones together and shout them all down But let them 
shout Let them sing The legend of this great party would 
spread to the Hague No one could say hereafter that a 
Commandant was a failure who was thus welcomed into 
his captives’ grotesque entertainments At eleven o’clock 
he bade them good-night and withdrew A few revellers 
escorted him to his lodgings and serenaded him He 
thanked God that he had the gift of popularity It was odd 
that he had ever doubted it 

A week later the Boxing Club met again The Com- 
mandant was invited but, feeling that habitual unbending 
might be bad for discipline, he made gracious excuses 
The blinds of the dormitory were drawn Drink was 
brought, three gramophones played, Sezley and Gestable 
put on boxing gloves and were prepared to box if any in- 
trusion by the garrison staff should make boxing necessary 
But they did not box They stood m the ring and applauded 
themselves The room was full of men shouting and sing- 
ing and stamping their feet To the sentries a few yards 
away, the uproar did not differ from that m which, a week 
earlier, the Commandant had shared They continued on 
their beat, the child-English were drunk again, German 
officers would certainly have behaved with more dignity 
Meanwhile Lewis’s bed had been pulled out of its corner 
The flap of linoleum was turned back, the trap-door 
" opened In each crescendo of cheering, Willett attacked the 
concrete with his crowbar 



ch iv THE FORT 55 

The material was stubborn and the attack prolonged 
What had been ajoke became a business Spontaneity died 
The cheering of boxers who did not box, the singing of 
bawdy songs by sober men, the intervening silences, the 
artificial cries of laughter and partisanship with which each 
hush was raked — all these it was necessary to orchestrate 
and control Lewis stood on a trunk with an ivory hair- 
brush in his hand He began to take pleasure in calling 
forth new combinations of sound, they excited him and 
made him laugh A group m a distant corner broke into 
song whenever his brush was pointed at it, another group 
sprang into obedient competition, when he stamped his 
feet, all feet were stamped, when he beckoned sound to- 
wards him, sound came, when both his hands were 
stretched out m repression, the uproar weakened He sig- 
nalled to Sezley and Gestable, instantly the room was full 
of the thud and patter of boxing gloves beaten against a 
wall A glance towards the crowbar having told him that 
Willett, with lips set and sweat running from him, was 
rested and prepared to attack again, he threw his clenched 
fists high above his head, the ivory brush flashed in the 
shine of the oil lamp, and the impact of steel upon concrete 
was drowned m yells of victory and groans of disappoint- 
ment 

“That’s enough,” Willett exclaimed at last, standing 
clear “You can dig to-morrow Keep the party going till 
we’ve closed down the trap and squared off ” 

For a little while the noise was continued Lumps of 
concrete were packed away into a locked trunk, by day 
they would be taken out to the ramparts one by one and 
dropped secretly into the moat The meeting of the Boxing 
Club dispersed, members who slept m other dormitories 
reeled into the mght, singing drunken catches, their gait 
carefully unsteady, their arms linked 

Gestable, inspired by the part he was playing, invented 
a liquorish quarrel “Never been m’sober l’me life 1 ” he 
protested with truth And even Carroll-Blair’s thm voice 
was to be heard uplifted m Harrovian song, which was all 
the song he knew 



THE FOUNTAIN

Lewis, m bed at last, picked up a book but could not 
read Night rounds are made at fixed hours, he thought 
If we have to dig late, we can avoid them But better dig 
m the early evening There are no dormitory rounds before 
midnight The shriek of a distant tram reminded him of 
his coming to the fort, of plodding across the fields at 
Herriot’s side The noise of the shouting and the throb- 
bing wail of the gramophones were still m his ears He 
saw again the faces of the singers uplifted towards him, 
their open mouths, their fixed eyes — they had been like a 
ring of dogs howling at the moon, and he felt again the 
ivory hairbrush under his fingers While the scene lasted he 
had been excited by it, had even been proud 

Ballater, m blue silk pyjamas, looked up from the maga- 
zine he was reading 

“Well?” he said “All right? pretty good staff work ” 

Sezley was lowering the oil lamps by their chains and 
puffing down their chimneys The room fell into darkness 
and silence 

Lewis and Ballater shared a watch as diggers and carriers 
One evening, when they were m the tunnel together, working 
by candlelight amid the thick smell of earth and crumbled 
masonry and stale air, Ballater dropped the tool he was 
using and said quietly “It’s a marvellous night outside 
Did you notice? The Plough bright as if there were a frost, 
but everything sniffing of summer ” He scraped sweat from 
his forehead with the edge of an earthy hand “This hole 
stinks like the double-bottoms of a cruiser Come on, 
let’s get the loose stuff shovelled back We haven’t room 
to work,” and, kneeling across the tunnel m single file, 
they began like two dogs to scrape earth backward between 
their legs This done, it was Ballater’s turn to hold the 
candle while Lewis attacked the earth-face 

“My God, Alison,” Ballater said, “why are we burrow- 
ing here like moles? When you came into the fort, did you 
imagine yourself doing this?” 

Lewis was struck, not only by the shaft of irony that had 
touched Ballater, but by a feeling of guilt and desolation 



CH IV 


THE FORT 


5 ? 


“No,” he said “I didn’t see myself as a man of action ” 
“Never again? Not even after the war?” 

Lewis was struggling with a ledge of earth m which 
stones were deeply embedded When he had broken it 
down, he replied 

“Perhaps never again I didn’t swear to that But I did 
swear to myself that while I was here and had this god- 
sent chance ” 

He could not continue In the confinement of the tunnel 
every conversation but a demand that the candle should be 
held higher or lower became ridiculous, and he returned 
to his work m silence But his thought ran on Solitude 
and a discipline of peaceful scholarship might prove, as 
Hernot had often suggested, not to be his ultimate way 
of life, he didn’t know, that lay m the future, some day he 
might have strength enough to preserve an absolute still- 
ness of the spirit, even amid the activities of the world 
But if ever this was to become possible, it could be made 
possible m him, he believed, only by the discipline of 
quietness The opportunity had been given him He 
remembered with what delight and with what assurance 
he had welcomed it Now, by every evening in the tunnel 
and by every thought of escape, he was betraying it 
“I’ll take over,” Ballater said, exchanging his candle for 
the tool with which Lewis had been digging “You’ve been 
hacking at it like a madman I shall take life more easily 
It must be nearly time for our reliefs ” 

Work had begun again, when a sound behind them, at 
the entrance of the tunnel, told that the trap-door had 
been hastily closed 

“Someone coming,” Ballater whispered, and ceased to 
dig, that the sound of his tool might not be heard above 
ground “Better put out the candle ” 

“No light can show through if they’ve got the lino- 
leum-flap down If they haven’t, we’re done ” 

“Still we may want the light later on The Lord knows 
how long we may not have to sit here if Willett can’t get 
rid of the man, whoever he is It may be the Commandant 
come to be affable He might stay for hours ”

“If he does,” Lewis added, “he’ll notice that we don’t 
come to bed ” 

“Oh, Willett will invent some lie ” 

“Can’t go on lying for ever ” 

“Anyhow,” Ballater said, “we shall quietly suffocate ” 
The candle was put out They lay in darkness on their 
stomachs and waited Lewis forgot that he was m the 
tunnel, and the bitterness of his self-reproach passed from 
him We make ourselves, he thought, by struggle and 
rule, but a force deeper than our will, deeper than our 
consciousness, corrects our making To cultivate the man 
of intellect is not enough, for stillness is a quality of the 
whole man We are like the strings of a stringed instru- 
ment which, slackened in any part, are dead, they can 
yield no music but the music proper to themselves and 
then only if their tension be just Each man must discover 
the perfect tension of his being — in action or solitude, m 
love or asceticism, m philosophy or faith — by continual 
adjustments of thought and experience, and he asked 
himself whether the particular seclusion of the fort might 
not be a phase from which he was emerging What develop- 
ment of his scholarship would attend the fresh impulses 
stirring within hum? But if the tunnel succeeds, he added, 
there may be no more scholarship His longing for seclu- 
sion returned, but for a seclusion that seemed to him, as 
he strove now to imagine it, less wintry, more beautiful 
and flowering, than that by which he had been bound 
He opened his eyes m the darkness and saw the 
pale glimmer of the fist on which his cheek had been 
resting 

“The trap-door is being opened,” Ballater said 
The gleam m the tunnel increased 
“All clear now,” said Willett, m the hoarse whisper of 
one who had a habit of conspiracy “You fellows still 
alive?” 

Weeks passed in digging and alarms That he might not 
cease to read, Lewis imposed daily tasks on himself and 
performed them, but he was restless and troubled When

news was brought to him in Jed well’s room that the tunnel 
had been discovered, he started from his chair, thinking 
at first only of the failure of his enterprise, but, as he went 
towards the dormitory, joy mounted within him and he 
thought Now I shall have peace Now there’ll be quiet 
again 

A servant m the dormitory had noticed the crease made 
by the continual turning back of the linoleum and, his 
curiosity aroused, had come upon the trap-door Whether 
the man made this discovery by chance or had been sent 
to investigate by Dutch officers aroused by some suspicion 
was not known, certainly he remained firm against threat 
and bribery and could not be prevented from making 
his report The Commandant was at first indignant The 
English officers had betrayed his trust m them They had 
rewarded his kindnesses by doing their utmost to rum his 
career Their ingratitude was shameful Had he not come 
himself as a friend to share their entertainments m this 
very room? An attempt was made to suggest to him that it 
was a duty of interned officers to escape if they could, but 
he was beyond reason If he was allowed to remain serious, 
they were lost, the wildest penalties would be imposed upon 
them, no weapon could now be effective against him but 
ridicule, only his vanity could be touched While others 
argued and the Commandant raged, Ferrard brought sal- 
vation 

“In this very room we drank and we laughed,” the 
Commandant cried “We trusted one another and were 
friends And you ” 

“Yes, sir,” said Ferrard quietly “We were all sports 
together Vive les Pays-Bas f ” 

The nng of serious, disappointed faces began to smile 
The Commandant saw mouths opemng to laugh The 
intolerable levity of the English, who would laugh at any- 
thing* Then, suddenly, as he perceived that they were 
laughing at him, his expression changed from anger to a 
pitiable embarrassment An instinct of self-preservation 
enabled him to see their joke He was delighted because he 
had seen it

l 


“Les Pays-Bas ? The Low Countries? That was it — the 
tunnel under the ground? Even then — so early?” 

He threw back his head and outlaughed them all Before 
his mood could change, they began to show him their 
tunnelling equipment old pyjamas stained with earth, their 
entrenching tool, the electric torches that had displaced 
candles which m the foul atmosphere of the inner tunnel 
would burn no longer, their stores of earth, Willett’s 
crowbar, the rules and agenda of the Boxing Club 

‘‘And I was your President 1 ” he exclaimed, when the 
purpose of the Club had been made clear to him But his 
face fell when he was invited to inspect the tunnel “Won’t 
you go down and look at it, sir?” Ferrard suggested “We 
can lend you some kit ” Should he preserve his dignity 
or m pyjamas regain the esteem of these barbarians? He 
smirked and hesitated Pyjamas were brought and he 
suffered them to be put on over his uniform, gloves were 
provided, a scarf was tied over his head His grotesque 
figure, having climbed through the trap-door, sank on its 
hands and knees and began to crawl into the hole 

“That’s the end of that,” Willett said gloomily, and 
turning to the servant who had discovered the tunnel, a 
timid little man in brown overalls, he exclaimed with 
bitter good-humour “Are you the one man on earth who 
won’t take a bribe?” 

“Ja, mynheer,” the Dutchman answered, understand- 
ing nothing 

Lewis turned away with a smile He could have shouted 
his gratitude for this saving farce A weight had been lifted 
from him This evening, the tunnel under his bed would 
be empty, he would light his candle and re-build his screen 
of books He was free again, and when he returned to 
Jedwell’s room, it seemed to have recovered much of its 
former composure 



CHAPTER FIVE 

Ballater resolved to spend in Enkendaal the days of 
leave to which he would be entitled in October, and was 
eager that Lewis should go with him Lewis hesitated now 
before refusing He did not feel himself to be as depend- 
ent as he had been on a strict continuity of existence m the 
fort But he chose still not to interrupt his work 

Soon after his decision had been made, he received a 
letter from Julie, the first that had passed between them 
It had been written, he felt, because she had found, as he 
had, an embarrassment m their silence and was deter- 
mined to end it They had known each other well in the 
past, they were exiles m the same country, his friend 
visited the Castle, it was unnatural that he and she should 
not communicate But the letter, though it had a deliberate 
ease, had not been easily written She had waited too long 
to write if she was to write easily “I didn’t write to you 
before because I gathered that you wanted to be left alone ” 
There was, he knew, another prohibition implied m her 
delay 

A reflex of it m himself enabled him to perceive its 
nature The letter — the material substance, the paper, the 
envelope, the handwriting — fascinated him When its con- 
tents was already known, he picked it up to read again, 
and found that what he desired was not to read the words 
but to see and touch the substance In the first letter that 
a man receives from a girl unknown to him but of whom 
an image, undefined but beautiful, has already formed 
itself among the half-shadows of his consciousness, there 
is an exquisite prompting or summons that is independent

THE FOUNTAIN 


l 


of the words’ message The summons is not that of 
curiosity only, and certainly not of analytical curiosity 
Lewis did not examine the handwriting as a graphologist 
would have examined it, seeking indications of character 
m the upstrokes and the down, the fine, soaring f s, the 
^’s that tucked their tails away under their bodies like 
little fat dogs seated on a hearthrug, the light, airy swirl 
of a capital S, the mingling of childish compactness and 
flowing impulse that was Julie’s hand He observed these 
things but had no more thought of them than that her 
handwriting was pretty and unusual, so he might have 
said of a man’s writing that it was “pleasant” or “neat” 
or “ragged” — smudged, clumsy words all of them, the 
small-talk of a mind centred elsewhere than m the chilly 
indication of *’s and g ’ s What drew him to the letter 
was not the particular indications that it gave but the 
feminine presence that it evoked She — but who was 
she ? he did not know her — she, her very self, was com- 
municated m the letter that had lain beneath her hand, 
and the communication seemed to be the more complete 
because it represented no particular aspect of a known 
human being If he had known what her fingers were like, 
his imagination of the contact of a hand with this sheet of 
paper would have been restricted by his knowledge If he 
had ever seen her at any writing-table, twisting her foot, 
perhaps, round the leg of her chair or dipping her pen m 
some especial manner, his imagination would have been 
pegged by fact, he would not have been aware, as he now 
was, of a thousand opposed but, m his own mind, har- 
monious possibilities, he could not have perceived the 
light, hard pressure of a table’s edge beneath her breasts, 
the indentation made by her leaning, the coolness of 
polished wood beneath her wrist, and, at the same time, 
have watched the writing of this letter on a stool beside 
a fire — a sunken fire, it seemed to be, from which light 
glowed on her paper, the paper now flatly lit by the 
autumnal pallor of Jedwell’s room 

This bleak, and light on the paper, deeply contrasted 
with the delicious warmth of perception that the letter 



ch v THE FORT 63 

had caused m him, quickened his sense of exhaled in- 
dividuality He seemed to hold in his hand not a letter, 
a thing completed and therefore sparkless, dead, but the 
animation, the moving essence, from which it had sprung, 
and the name Julie, not Julie Narwitz, seemed to him a 
kind of wordless confession, for, he thought, her signature, 
when her eye falls upon it, does not appear to her as a 
label which, like a number, is useful to distinguish her 
from others, but as an expression of herself of which the 
ever-changing secret eludes her While she was writing, 
the word Julie was for her a coded summary of her 
mysteries Between the J and the e she was lying, her 
inmost self as much expressed and as much concealed as 
when, m that other visible but clouded formula — her body, 
she lay extended long ago on sunlit grass, or stood looking 
up at him, being then a child 
The child also, he remembered suddenly, had used the 
same word Julie Imprisoned m memory, but gazing at 
the run of ink m the word before him, he saw for an instant 
the child, with elbow cocked and pen m hand, writing 
this letter, then, as memory released him, saw her change 
under his eyes into woman The change brought with it a 
stinging, pervasive delight — the whip of a gust on a still 
day She, too, must have been aware of the gust, the sweet 
mvigoration, the heady sharpness of it, for that reason she 
long delayed her letter, and, when she did write, wrote as 
though the calm were unbroken Reading again her easy 
phrases, he felt the stress in them Why hadn’t he come 
to EnkendaaP It was lovely at this time of year He might 
find books in the library that he needed, besides, it would 
be good to see him again, the Dutch were so dull “I think 
I’m changed a great deal, but you won’t have changed at 
all When I was twelve you always seemed so old that you 
can’t have become older — perhaps younger again There’s 
consolation for you 1 ” Then news, stiff and brief How 
sorry they all had been to hear of the discovery of the 
tunnel 1 It must have been sickemng after so much work! 
Then, with a twinge of nervousness perceptible in the 
raising of the key “You won’t mind your pupil’s being

married to a German husband? He’s different from most 
Prussians m some rather important ways I believe you’d 
like him You’d talk philosophy together ” After the 
words “like him,” a word had been begun and crossed 

out “I believe you’d like him better than ?” “Better 

than I do,” Lewis guessed, but it was no more than a 
guess If that was what she had intended to vmte, m how 
forced a mood of mock seriousness she must have written 1 
He saw her plan the graceless joke, begin to write it, then 
fall back before its shrillness, her taste prevailing over the 
embarrassment that had stood at her elbow, dragging her 
pen into protective commonplace, jerking it into staccato 
concealments 

Two days later came another letter m the same hand 
My dear Lewis, 

I think the letter I wrote must have been a very 
silly one I was feeling all the time that I didn’t know you, 
and that you would turn my letter over thinking that the 
little girl you knew was pretending to be what she wasn’t 
I couldn’t get it clear And it’s not much clearer now, is 
it? But if you ever come out of your monastery, I’ll try 
to make intelligent amends And now, how do I finish a 
letter to you? The way I used to end when you were at 
Oxford was — 

With love from T 

Julie 

His reply to her first letter crossed the second They 
did not write again 

The diplomats did their work at leisure and the autumn 
passed without assurance of general parole That it would 
m the end be granted there was little doubt, for the Dutch 
themselves were eager to be free of the responsibilities and 
expense of a garrison, and Ballater, who was always well 
informed, brought back with him, after each of his adven- 
turous visits to the outer world, authoritative statements 
that on such and such a date parole would be signed The 



ch v THE FORT 6s 

dates passed and on each occasion there were reasons, 
which could never recur, for fortune’s having tricked him 
into a mistake 

“The only thing that worries me about leaving the fort,” 
Ballater said, “is that I shall have to leave my garden be- 
hind, but up at Enkendaal there’s a cottage belonging to 
a man called Kerstholt that has a garden, and if we took 
rooms there ” 

The canals were clipped in winter and the barbed wire 
was furry with snow before it became certain that, m the 
third week of February, they would leave the fort, not to 
return Three officers rejected parole, preferring banish- 
ment to an island m the Zuyder Zee A few months earlier 
Lewis would have chosen to join them rather than go out 
into the world Now, listening to Ballater’s description of 
the great solitudes about Enkendaal, the heaths and elms, 
the lakes upon which the Castle looked down, the library 
m its tower, he consented to do what Ballater wished The 
fort had grown old for him, perhaps because he had allowed 
it to grow old At Enkendaal also there would be seclusion, 
and a seclusion continuously refreshed by the changing 
moods of the countryside In heath and lake and forest, 
becoming day by day parts of his own life, there would be 
a serene quickness that could never exist for him m a land- 
scape of which he remained a withheld spectator Though 
for several weeks he had been working without disquiet 
and was happy within the enclosure of these snowy ram- 
parts, he knew that he was but in the infancy of the life 
he desired and must proceed beyond it 

“I was half afraid you wouldn’t come,” Ballater said, 
and at once allowed his plans to overflow “As a matter of 
fact, I more or less booked Kerstholt’s cottage when I was 
at Enkendaal, though I didn’t tell you then There’s room 
enough for two of us and for a couple of our own men we 
can get up from the camp as servants And there’s a garden 
And a shed I can have for a car There’s only one trouble 
Kerstholt has his wife’s relations coming to stay, and we 
can’t get m until early Apnl I’ll go to stay at the Castle 
late m March and have everything fixed m the cottage

before you come Can you put m your time until 
then?” 

‘Til go and dig in libraries at Leiden and Amsterdam 
and the Hague, and collect more books ” 

“Good,” said Ballater ‘Tm going to buy a car Do you 
know anything about cars?” 

On the last day he would spend m the fort, a day of 
February so boon and mild that it seemed already to have 
spring m it, Lewis went out on to the ramparts carrying 
with him one of the few books that he had saved from 
the crating of his library It remained long m the grip of 
his arm while he observed in a mood of peaceful accept- 
ance how the new year, whose movement he would no 
longer witness from this place, was repeating the miracles 
with which the old had received him The cottage gardens 
beyond the moat were flecked with snowdrops, in the elms, 
rooks were pairing again, and I, with my crate of books 
that must go with me everywhere, he said, I am frosted 
m knowledge and cannot renew myself I listen but hear 
no voice I am like a tree in which the sap does not rise 
And he began to ask himself, as he had asked many times, 
by what discipline he might attain to that stillness which 
should enable him to hear and to that brilliance of percep- 
tion which should enable him to see But the disciplines 
and compulsions of life are not all, they are what a man 
may do for himself, but he cannot do all As he cannot be 
a poet by will, or a lover by will, neither by will alone can 
he become a creature of the spirit, but by a yielding, an 
abandonment — he put the thought away from him for he 
could not complete it, and sat down among the elm trees 
that overlooked the water, wondering whether the elms at 
Enkendaal of which Ballater had spoken stood near the 
bnm of the Castle lakes Here their images and the image 
of the grassy bank on which he was sitting were so held in 
the metallic surface of the moat that they seemed to be 
engraved upon it He would remember the fort by their 
- quietness even more than by the grey shadows and flecked, 
infrequent sunshine of Jed well’s room, more than by the

THE FORT

delight of the summer days when he and Ballater had swum 
together Next summer the water would he still perpetu- 
ally, none would swim in it, and the children on the oppo- 
site bank, seeing no movement on the ramparts, would 
forget those who had moved there sooner than they forgot 
the beings of a tale They would forget them as they forgot 
the dead 

“And what is the book, Alison?” Jedwell said “It looks 
like an old one ” He sat down beside Lewis and let the 
pages run beneath his thumb “German, too? What is it — 
prayers?” 

“And other things Fve pencilled a translation here and 
there ” Recalled by the book to the earlier movement of 
his thought that morning, Lewis took it from Jedwell and, 
opening it at a passage which had long troubled him and 
which for his own help he had translated, he forgot his 
companion and began to read silently 

“When I was a boy, God held my hand, but I escaped 
from Him, and m my youth, having need of peace, I said 
I will find Him I scoured the city with my lamp, well- 
trimmed, and so bright that my companions envied me it 
I searched the countryside diligently, I inquired of the 
stars with a candle, I was humble and crawled the earth, 
looking into the holes of foxes and beneath the petals of 
flowers But I found neither truth nor rest, for, like a wit- 
less child and many a learned man before me, I had forgot 
what it was I sought So I set down my lamp and my 
candle, I threw away my keys and wept, and straightway 
His light was within me When I returned to the city, I 
was not empty of it Now I am m the liberty of His prison 
though all the world hammer at the gate Give me Thy 
hand, O God, when Thou summonest me forth ” 

The German Protestants, he thought when he had read 
and read again, were m the earliest days men who feared 
their own learning, even while they laboured to acquire it 
Though their maturity was in rebellion, their childhood 
had been m submission, and no one outlives all his child- 
hood What was meant by “I threw away my keys and 
wept”? Keys of dogma, perhaps, which had been re- 



THE FOUNTAIN 


i 


68 

nounced The lamp was of learning, the candle of a faith 
too weak, but the keys — It was vain to press for the detail 
of allegory The upshot was plain 
At the end of the same volume, he remembered, among 
Prayers for Several Occasions was one that might well have 
been written at the same time, though no commentator had 
marked the similarity of thought 
“Grant, Eternal Spirit, to us who kneel before Thy dark- 
ness that it may become light by Thy Grace, for we have 
but a sickly spark within us Blow upon us with Thy 
breath, though we feel it not, lead us, though we follow 
not, receive us, though our pride reject Thy consolation, 
for save by Thee we cannot come to Thee and, unless Thou 
showest it, there is no end ” 

At first he was interested only to probe the mind of the 
writer and to ask whether, when he wrote, praying for 
compulsion to faith, he had already passed, though he did 
not know it, beyond a condition of inquiry into an ardour 
of faith How else could he pray thus? How far was this 
man, who had stood so long between self-vindication and 
self-abandonment, advanced on his way towards mystical 
ecstasy? How far on the road to Damascus? And because 
the way to Damascus seemed to Lewis but one of the 
many ways of contemplation, he considered this writer’s 
progress upon it with the detachment of a student, but 
soon his attempt to project his mind into the thought of 
another, that he might the better understand it, trans- 
muted analysis into imagination, and, struggling to re- 
create the circumstances that had here drawn learning to 
its knees, asking himself what had been the nature of the 
apprehension spoken of in the words “and straightway His 
light was within me,” he found an answer not of reason 
only There seemed to be, not indeed a light within him, 
not a voice or a touch, but an encirclement of himself, and 
within the encirclement a visitation, so that, though he saw 
as he had seen, and heard as he had heard, the outward 
sense being still present and unchanged, he was yet aware 
"‘of other eyes seeing through his eyes, of another in- 
dividuality moving behind the reasoned movement of his

brain Into this individuality he wished to fall back but 
could not, it stayed behind him and at a remove, attendant 
but not possessing, and presently it ceased to be, and he 
was on the ramparts alone 

When he had risen, he saw a little figure walking slowly 
along the western rampart Before disappearing round the 
corner, Jedwell turned and waved to him

CHAPTER ONE 

From unpacking books which he had brought with him 
that day from the Hague, Lewis had fallen into reading 
them, and, the afternoon being now advanced, had drawn 
near to the window that opened upon Kerstholt’s garden 
and was holding a volume towards the light He was lost 
m it and happily lost, for its subject was so much in 
harmony with his own mood that the writer, leaving the 
seventeenth century, had thrown a spell of intimacy over 
the solitary hour that Lewis had spent m his company — 
the intimacy of speech, even of tranquil argument 

“Meditations m order to a good life,” this writer was 
saying, “let them be as exalted as the capacity of the person 
and subject will endure, up to the height of contempla- 
tion, but if contemplation comes to be a distinct thing, and 
something beside or beyond a distinct degree of virtuous 
meditation, it is lost to all sense, and religion and prudence 
Let no man be hasty to eat of the fruits of paradise before 
his time ” Here Lewis paused, and looked up sharply, 
allowing the volume to close upon his finger Beyond the 
garden, footsteps were approaching, and an accompani- 
ment of voices, Ballater’s and a girl's He withdrew from 
the window, feeling certain that Ballater, who had not 
expected him to arnve until nightfall, would not suspect 
his presence 

He would have liked to put the intruders out of his 
mind but could not, and, kneeling beside a packing-case, 
he listened to them as their voices became distinct and 
their steps sounded m the gravel of the little ascent be- 
tween the lane and the cottage Their conversation was 

73 



THE FOUNTAIN 


n 


74 

animated and gay, evidently they were delighted in each 
other’s company and Ballater was already at ease He is 
always soon at ease, Lewis thought That is the charm of 
him to me as well as to women He treats every woman, 
neither as a stranger nor as quarry, but as if he and she 
had long ago come to a smiling agreement that she should 
not be his mistress — an agreement capable of being re^ 
scinded 

They were standing beneath the window, and Ballater, 
with a delightful, childlike boasting, was telling her 
solemnly — for he was always solemn about the little 
attainments of which he was proud — what he would do 
with the garden and how by next spring it would be 
transformed “Next spring!” she said “The war will be 
over before then You will be in England again ” 

Lewis ceased to listen Though he had known Julie 
when she was a child m England, he felt now detached 
from those memories and was eager to fortify himself m 
detachment from them He began again to order his books 
in their shelves and to wonder whether so much care was 
wasted — whether this precious time of isolation m Holland 
would end before the coming of another spring Then, m 
the garden, he heard his own name spoken Kerstholt, 
coming from his own quarters at the back of the house, 
was explaining in Dutch that the other English officer had 
arrived more than two hours ago “Alison?” Ballater cried 
“Where is he, then?” He raised his voice and shouted 
“Alison! Alison! are you there? Here’s an old friend of 
yours come to see you ” Lewis did not answer There were 
matches m his hand, for he had intended to light a candle, 
but he let them return with a little clack into the bowl of 
the candlestick 

“I expect he’s gone for a walk,” Ballater said “Unless 
he’s hiding ” 

Julie dropped her voice “If he’s hiding — do bring 
him out ” 

“He can’t be Look, there are no lights m the windows 
It must be getting dark inside Besides, why on earth 
should he hide?” 



CH I

75 

“He might,” she answered “Do see ” And in a dancing 
tone, mischievous and wilful, she repeated “Do bring 
him out ” 

Ballater laughed at her “You sound very fierce,” he 
said “As if the poor devil were a badger in his earth Are 
you a huntress?” 

She laughed back — a laugh of challenge and mockery 
and enticement Until then, Lewis had been indifferent to 
her, content to wait among the shadows until she and 
Ballater were gone Now her laughter invaded him, he 
grew hot, as if she had struck him m the face with some 
stinging flower, and even when she went away, Ballater 
having offered to walk across to the Castle with her, the 
sting — the turbulence it had provoked and the unacknow- 
ledged delight of it — increased in his memory The room 
was not quiet now as it had been before her coming 

And as he moved from sitting-room to bedroom, carry- 
ing great armfuls of books, he began to understand that, 
though the laughter he had heard was that of Julie Narwitz, 
the laughter that was still sounding in his mind came 
from a remote past m which he had been a very young 
man and Julie Quillan a child, and he remembered how 
one day, when he was an Oxford freshman and he and 
she were wandering together through the Harbury 
meadows, she had patted his pocket for the shape of the 
volume that was bulging m it and had asked him to 
read it to her “But it's Greek,” he had said, “and you 
have enough to do m Latin ” A clumsy, stupid saying, 
which she had disregarded Opening the book at random, 
“Please read it, Lewis,” she had insisted, and, with her 
child’s hand m his, had walked beside him while he read, 
checking him now and then at a line while she tried to 
imitate the sound of it, and, when he solemnly corrected 
her, teasing him with her laughter When they had 
walked a little while, she had dropped on her knees in the 
grass, still holding his hand so that he was drawn down 
beside her Turned upon her face, she had lam with no 
movement but of her breathing, the white nape of her 
neck, where the long hair fell away on either side, exposed

to a dapple of sunlight amid the flickering shadow of beech 
leaves She persuaded him to translate the story, which 
had been of Nausicaa 

Not long afterwards, she had been taken away A pupil 
had gone, an airy companion, a pleasant child — no more 
it had seemed to him then The sudden curtailment of his 
Oxford days, his entry into his father’s business, the re- 
sponsibility that fell upon him at his father’s death, the 
straitening and self-discipline of life from that time 
forward — these had curbed his spirit, the Odyssey had 
been put away — all his odysseys, the dreaming and, it 
seemed, the memory of them But the memory of his 
association with Richard Quillan’s child had persisted as 
an undertone to all emotion, a secret that he had not been 
able fully to discover to himself From it even now he 
sheered suddenly away, picking up the Odyssey from a 
pile of books, carrying it to the window-light, and telling 
himself it was not for a personal reason, but for the merit 
of the tale, that there seemed to him to be no story equal 
m magic with the story of Nausicaa 

When he looked up from the Odyssey, he saw Kerstholt 
m the garden — a veritable Dutch peasant, short, high- 
shouldered and sinewy, who carried his years with stub- 
born and ungraceful vigour Observing the Englishman 
at the open window, the old man asked what war news 
there had been in the Hague that morning There was 
nothing, Lewis replied, that had not been told before 
“You don’t hear the guns m EnkendaaP” he added “No,” 
said Kerstholt “It’s quiet, Enkendaal,” and so quietly 
did he say it, as if a deeply rooted tree were speaking m 
the interior of a forest, that Lewis’s mind was emptied of 
disturbance and he also began to think of the seclusion 
of Enkendaal where, ringed about by guns and delivered 
from the pressure of existence, he was free to create a new 
life withm himself He went down into the garden and 
talked to Kerstholt, who grinned and exclaimed because 
an Englishman spoke Dutch so well “Do you know the 
-flowers and the trees, Jonk’er? Did you know Dutch before 
you came to Holland? Of course, the Freule Julie is English 



ch i THE CASTLE 77 

and she speaks Dutch, but she won’t speak it if she can 
help it Always English or French with her — and now 
German, may be, since she married a German ” The old 
man’s tongue ran on, he was curious to know how an 
Englishman, who was neither Baron nor Count, was a 
friend of the Baron van Leyden van Enkendael “There 
are not many Dutch he would allow to take rooms m my 
cottage, so near to his own Castle ” 

Lewis explained that Julie and her mother had lived 
near his own home in England 

“Ah, that is how it was,” said Kerstholt “I remember 
they told me Then you are just a friend of the Freule ” 
And he added after a long pause “Of course, she is not van 
Leyden ” 

Lewis went out of the garden and found himself m a 
narrow lane, hedged on one side but lying open on the 
other, he could see how the ground fell away towards 
the few houses lining the avenue that led to the Castle 
gates The Castle itself he could not see, but he had been 
told where it lay, and he went on through the dusk, look- 
ing for a wood that Kerstholt had said he would presently 
find before him “If you walk straight on through the 
wood, you will come out by the pavilion — a little place 
like a pepper-box where the Castle ladies sometimes take 
their tea m summer — and below the pepper-box you’ll 
see the lakes, Jonk’er, and the Castle stands on the other 
side of the lakes ” Lewis did not greatly care whether or 
not he came upon the Castle that evening To be alone 
was all his desire, and, coming to the edge of the wood, 
he paused and held his breath There was no sound but 
the rustle of leaves and far away a famt movement of 
water The lakes must have a fall between them, he 
reflected, and, climbing the low bank at the roadside, 
entered the wood 

The undergrowth was very dark, but, this extreme spur 
of the wood being not more than a couple of hundred 
yards in breadth, the thickemng day was visible beyond 
it The smoother trunks were streaked with light A grey, 
luminous stream appeared to be flowing down them, and,

from the tops of bushes, glazed leaves of evergreen threw 
up the sky again On the farther side of the wood there 
was a vague shimmering, as though the outskirts, and the 
outskirts only, were wrapped in a gigantic cobweb of light, 
but this dissolved as Lewis approached it, and he saw 
before him, just beyond the wood, and on raised ground 
that concealed any farther prospect, a little pillared build- 
ing with a flattened dome ana ornate capitals I might 
work there if the van Leydens will let me, he thought 
Beyond it are the lakes, and no one is likely to come by 
the wood, it would be an island in effect 
But when he reached the pavilion, he saw that he had 
misjudged its position It was farther from the water’s 
edge than he had suspected At his feet was an expanse 
of shelving ground along which a path, that appeared and 
disappeared among close shrubs, followed the water-line, 
and, crossing this path, was another that connected the 
pavilion with the shore The sharp point of land to which 
it led was almost met by the nose of a miniature peninsula 
thrust out from the farther bank Between them, water 
flowed from lake to lake m a soft cascade The fall was 
not more than the height of a child, and the cascade was 
spanned by a bridge On the peninsula, over a gleam of 
steps, was a low block of darkness that seemed to be a 
boathouse but was hardly to be distinguished from its 
background, for behind it the Castle’s chief tower rose 
out of the waters of the upper lake This tower, a great- 
girthed cylinder of ancient brick, was little superior m 
height to the other buildings of the Castle, which lay 
clustered beyond it, but it had the character of Dutch 
grandeur, a superb austerity, an aloof composure, and 
the eye was held by its rooted plainness Two slits of light 
shone m its upper part, repeated m unrippled elongation 
by the surface of the water below Whoever occupies that 
room, Lewis thought, must hear the plashing of the water

the contemporary world and for such a man as he, it must 
be possible to reduce all worldly action to the plashing of 
water day and night until it became at last, though un- 
ceasing, a part of silence wherein the spirit was free Then 
might not all the life of the flesh, its delights and torments, 
even the plain earning of bread — the going every day to 
office or factory, the performance of labour that seemed 
to have no heart m it, be recognized as that of which 
spiritual sanctuary was the essence, as the necessary con- 
dition of it ? Not to kill the senses or to hate them, he 
thought, but to discover an inviolable ghost m the sensible 
body is the highest and most difficult art of the saints 
Solitude would have no meamng if it were not encircled, 
nor peace if it were not threatened In the fort, life stood still, 
but it was crowded and stagnant — an enforced monasticism 
without rule Here, day after day, I shall live m an en- 
closed freedom without need or possibility of escape from 
it He felt the excitement and awe of a child who for the 
first time recognizes his own individuality and sees him- 
self, a solitary and adventurous figure, travelling through 
a virgin landscape from birth to death An indefinite sweep 
of seasons rolled ahead of him like a great moorland, un- 
mapped, unconfined, a continent of experience, and he 
became impatient even of the dusk and eager for the 
morning to which the sun would awake him in his bed- 
room at the cottage In the act of waking, he would re- 
member that a day of early spring lay before him, the 
first of many days not to be counted or distinguished — 
an empty day, mdmsibly his own, whose very air, quick 
but still, would have the quality of meditation, and he 
would welcome it, and each of its successors, with a silent 
cry of the heart as a new gift miraculously given 
In the middle of the upper lake, beyond the shadow of 
the tower, he saw again now what his eyes had previously 
seen but his mind had not recorded — an eyot thickly 
wooded and shaped like a pair of blunt boats lashed gun- 
wale to gunwale Whoever occupied the room in the tower 
would learn to know the seasons and the weather by the 
changing appearances of the eyot and of the water round

it, and would, perhaps, if observation reached back into 
childhood, invest it with a thousand legends — seeing m it 
the ship that Poseidon changed into an island as she re- 
turned from Ithaca, or another ship launched m a private 
dream It would be easy in this place to dream a dream 
into reality In so great a quietness, while the evening sky 
lay m the water of the lake and the scud of a bird was 
the silent drawing of a diamond across a mirror of steel, 
it was hard to understand that the scene was not perpetual, 
but must be resolved into night and morning and be con- 
sumed in the succession of days 
But though one who had attained to that spiritual de- 
tachment within the world which was the destination of 
philosophy might see an earthly image of it m this scene, 
Lewis perceived, with a sensation of humility that was ahm 
to fear, that for him nothing existed but the image, the 
reality being infinitely distant And not the supreme reality 
only, the inviolable sanctuary of the saints After the war, 
he would live as he had always lived, plainly and without 
affectation, performing what tasks were required of him, 
but he wanted to be able to endure disappointment without 
bitterness, to learn to accept the burdens of his life m Eng- 
land w thout the necessity of guarded and enforced patience, 
to receive immediate beauty without being prompted by 
it to hunger for beauty unattainable He wanted to create 
within him a retiring place which the fret of common ex- 
istence and the hot breezes of desire and fear and ambi- 
tion should be powerless to disturb How far he was even 
from this lesser end, he knew well enough, and how un- 
schooled m travel He stumbled from thought to thought, 
from book to book, from dream to dream, he had scarcely 
learned to ask his way or to understand the answers he 
received He could not hold steadfastly to his course, 
there was a weak discipline upon his meditation, a girl’s 
laughter could make him swerve from it, leaving him 
angry and afraid Even now, he added, while I have 
been standing here and have seen the water darken at 
the foot of the tower, perhaps I have been waiting to 
have that anger renewed m me, for several minutes have

gone by since I seemed to hear the brush of shoulders 
against the bushes of that narrow path and the approach 
of voices 

So he went forward, and, rounding a wall of bushes, 
came upon a little open space that looked out over the 
lakes At the edge of it she and Ballater stood, their backs 
towards him, the pallor above the water describing their 
figures with a lucent edge Her arm was raised to point 
towards the Castle 

“I have that room in the tower/’ she said, “where you 
see the lights I can get away from them there ” 

“But do you dislike them?” Ballater asked 

“Dislike them? Well no But I don’t belong I’m 
not Dutch ” 

“Nor are we for that matter ” 

“There’s no need for you to be You are strangers Your 
pedigree doesn’t affect the kennel Your mother wasn’t a 
Hoek and didn’t marry into a litter of Leydens ” She 
turned abruptly “Walk with me to the bridge Then you 
must go back ” 

As they advanced side by side, she lifted her head, 
checked herself, and suddenly ran forward 

“Lewis!” She took both his hands in hers “Look,” she 
cried over her shoulder to Ballater, “didn’t I tell you he 
was my schoolmaster?” for Lewis had stiffened at her 
touch and could not answer her “He used to kiss me when 
I was a defenceless child ” 

Still holding his hands, she leaned away from him, 
searching his face, he felt the weight of her body on his 
arms, the curl and pressure of her fingers m his 

“Lewis, where have you been — walking? alone? We went 
to the cottage and shouted for you Kerstholt said you had 
come up from the Hague hours ago I wanted to see you 
You don’t know what it is to have English people here Mr 
Ballater and I ” 

Her chatter ended, she released Lewis’s hands and stood 
before him 

“Am I what you expected?” she asked, and, giving him 
no time to answer, she went on in a changed voice “Your

THE FOUNTAIN 


n 


being here doesn’t seem real even now I think of you 
wandering about Daddy’s library m Natton Lodge — your 
arms too long for your sleeves O Lewis, I’ve so much to 
tell you ” 

“I too,” he said, “think of you as you were then 99 
“And now?” 

He laughed and hesitated He saw that Ballater had 
charmed her He himself must seem awkward and old, it 
was a mocking sentimentality m her, less than half serious, 
which had made her speak of their early days together 
And, observing her beauty, seeing how she challenged his 
opinion of it, he said with forced and stifled breath 
“You are almost in the dark I can see nothing ” 

She seized his hand, ran with him across the clearing 
to the place where she and Ballater had stood side by 
side 

“Now there’s light,” she said “What do you see?” 

The curve of her shoulders, the uplifted pallor of her 
face, her throat’s gleam, her body’s suppleness, her eyes 
like the challenge of a bayonet in a quiet path — he could 
not tell her what he saw or how he was in arms against the 
invasion of his being He said quietly “You are mad still,” 
and, even as he spoke, blamed himself for having said an 
unusual thing that betrayed emotion m him 
“Am I?” she answered “An older kind of madness, 
then ” 

“Older?” 

“I’m not a child ” 

“Of course not ” 

Seeing her look at him doubtfully, he remembered that 
she had never been sure how seriously to take him “You 
know I’m married,” she began, and added deliberately 
“ — to a German ” 

“I know ” 

“Then I’m not a child,” she repeated with a child’s per- 
sistence, and continued swiftly “Lewis, what’s the matter? 
You are hating me Why? Because I ran you out here? Has 
that offended you?” 

Hating her? He felt again the touch of her hand, and 



ch i THE CASTLE 83 

grasped it He said “No,” glad that his face was almost 
concealed from her 
“But you were hating me? Why?” 

“Perhaps because you’re not a child still — or because 
you are ” 

Ballater came up, bareheaded He stood grinning at 
them, his weight on one leg, like an affable stork 

“Well,” he said, “isn’t she beautiful? And you have 
known her all these years, Alison, and let her escape to 
Holland f” 

“I was carried off,” she replied, and added with elaborate 
carelessness — “I’m imprisoned, too, if you knew it ” 
“Can one imprison ghosts?” Ballater said 
“Ghosts?” 

“You look like a ghost m this light ” He laughed at her 
“As if you had risen from the lake ” 

She held out her hand “Then you must say good-bye 
to flesh and blood ” 

Ballater stooped over her fingers and kissed them with 
an elaborate flourish “To see if you are flesh and blood,” 
said he 

“And you, Lewis? No, you must kiss my hand too 
This isn’t England, and I’m a ghost ” 

He had taken her hand in his and she would not release 
him until he had done obeisance She would not release 
him Her first tone of nervous mockery was m her voice 
“If you will not,” she said, “I shall hold you here all 
night — or I shall kiss you ” 

He bent quickly over her hand and put his lips to it 
“That’s a penance for hating me, Lewis, dear Don’t 
always hate me or you will have to do penance again ” She 
went down towards the bridge and suddenly looked back 
“In the morning, I’ll absolve you, perhaps,” 



CHAPTER TWO 


Lewis spent the morning in the seventeenth century, a 
noble period m Holland, and m England, he was inclined 
to think, of all periods the greatest Yet how can one com- 
pare, as “greater” or “less great,” phases of history? The 
adjective is a dangerous one which may become the empty 
rhetoric of a criticism too lazy to define its pleasures and 
distinguish their sources A student of history, he thought, 
must beware of supposing that the men of the past are 
arraigned before him for his approval or condemnation, 
he is not their judge Nor is he what many historians are 
content, and even eager, to remain — a visitor with a cloak 
of darkness, a notebook and a curious eye, loving facts, as 
avarice loves diamonds, for the value given them by their 
rarity An histonan has much m common with an artist, 
he must yield himself to his subject and become a creature 
of the time he investigates, standing apart from it only 
now and then, as a traveller, wishing to examine a map 
which he alone possesses, may for a little while leave his 
companions, soon to rejoin them He must be able to accept 
the limitations of contemporary vision that he may ex- 
perience its intensity, endeavouring to feel, and not merely 
to understand, the Elizabethans’ terror of youth’s depar 
ture, and to participate in that exquisite insanity of passion 
which gave to their actions a desperate fire, to their lyrics 
a charged melancholy, not now to be recaptured Not to 
be recaptured? Lewis asked himself Who knows? For 
youth has become precious again, life is threatened and 
short, its end terrible and violent, once more death’s hand 
is on every boy’s shoulder But not on every girl’s, he

added, as it was in the ages of pestilence, and though there 
are women whose love for men will enable them to see, 
with men’s eyes, how time has shrunk suddenly to this 
day, this hour, this sweet and vanishing instant, and how, 
by that shrinking, the spirit of man is driven m upon its 
ultimate defences, such women are few, as poets are few, 
and many will suppose that but one conclusion may be 
drawn from the saying “to-morrow we die ” And by 
women, poets are ruled Women give an age its colour, 
not because they themselves are omnipotent but because 
men, being children first and last, see their god through 
women, and have no peace but at the breast and no 
imagination of rebirth but m the similitude of a womb 
Solitary men are like cut flowers in a pot, they are beautiful 
but they wither, being without nourishment, yet, if man 
consent to be nourished of woman, he, like a flower, is 
rooted and held, there is no escape until his earth receive 
him again 

Coming upon this knot m thought, making again his 
perpetual discovery that asceticism, which is a stage m the 
spirit’s journey, is also a refusal of the nourishment by 
which that journey may be sustained, he turned away 
from it and back to the book on his knee, saying to himself 
All thought leads me to this thought How was I led to 
it from thinking of the way in which history should be 
studied? And resolute not to wander again from his page, 
he continued to read until at about one o’clock he heard 
Ballater’s footfall on the gravel and went down to join 
him 


They must call on the Baroness m the afternoon, 
Ballater decided when luncheon was over, and might well 
walk over the moors until the time came As they walked, 
he spoke eagerly of his management of the household 
affairs of the cottage, inviting Lewis’s approval of his 
arrangements, telling how he had chosen as servants two 
seamen, Reeve and Garkie, from his Antwerp company, 
and demonstrating m what ways his insight into character 

D 



86 


THE FOUNTAIN 


n 


had been justified There was something charming and 
ingenuous m his pride, he was delighted by praise of his 
skill m choosing a dinner or a new wall-paper and told 
more than once how Julie had smiled upon his handiwork 
“The men and I haven’t been here a week, and yesterday 
she said we’d done wonders She was sure no woman would 
have made so many changes m the time But then 
women make the devil of a fuss about running a house,” 
he added “If you know your own mind and stick to a 
clear routine, it’s easy enough ” 

Without this streak of pompousness, this blind spot in 
his humour, Ballater would have been a less amusing, 
because a more superficial, companion That anyone so 
gay could also be so solemn gave to his character a saving 
touch of mystery, you never knew on what subject he 
would be solemn next When, seeing the moors and woods 
stretch out to the horizon, they spoke of the van Leyden 
estate, his thought flew to the Ballater acres and soared to 
his ideal landlordism His uncle’s land was the best m six 
counties, he declared proudly, but it needed scientific 
cultivation “That’s what I mean to study here Not that 
even m Holland some of ’em aren’t pretty stubborn against 
new ideas The other day I was talking to old van Leyden 
about sugar-beet, and I threw out an idea of my own — 
just threw it out, you know, to see what he’d say — and he 
tugged at his beard, and hummed and hawed, and said 
that had never struck him! Seemed impressed, but he 
won’t do anything, you know He’s too old, like my own 
uncle But Goof 1 van Leyden 
Lewis had already heard of Govert van Leyden, called 
Goof, a younger son who had a place of his own at the 
Huis ten Borgh, half chateau , halt farm 
Outwardly a correct young man and an ardent agri- 
culturist, he was believed to have lighter interests m the 
Hague and, indeed, at the Huis ten Borgh itself 
“I can get over m twenty-three minutes m the car,” 
Ballater said “I’m going to work there ” 

“All arranged* 1 You’ve been quick ” 

1 Pronounced Gofy 



ch ii THE CASTLE 87 

“Well, you see, Goof is keen on experiments m sugar- 
beet ” 

“Has he made any?” 

“Not yet But he will ” 

Ballater believed it He believed, too, for the time being, 
that it was the earnest farmer m Goof that was attracting 
him to the Huis ten Borgh His pink face was grave as he 
spoke of “modern ideas” and of the agricultural blindness 
of England which, when he went home, he proposed to 
remedy 

“Perhaps I ought to go into Parliament,” he said “And 
I shall have to marry, too You can’t run an estate — any- 
how not as I should like the Ballater estate to be run — 
without a wife ” 

“Is that the only motive?” 

“Well, one must have a son to inherit the property ” It 
was said without a flicker, and not until they had gone 
forward half-a-dozen paces did Ballater’s face move m a 
smile “I dare say there are other reasons too The devil of 
it is to choose the right girl ” 

“Is there a candidate?” 

“In a way — yes As a matter of fact there are three ” 

“Equal chances?” 

“Roughly — at a distance ” 

“And all willing?” 

A silence implied that, until this moment, Ballater had 
not doubted their willingness “I’ll show you their photo- 
graphs,” he said “But, of course,” he went on, “your idea 
in life is to make a kind of island for yourself Probably 
you’ll never marry But owning land’s a responsible job — 
and a damned fine job Land is in my blood — the land 
itself, not just what can be got out of it Farming, good 
farming, is more important than anything on earth, but it 
won’t be farming only that takes me to the Huis ten Borgh 
Although it’s scarcely ten miles away, it’s fresh landscape 
— a lower level, almost in the dyke country From the 
upper windows you can see the Rhine and the flat meadows 
beyond I don’t know why — the view’s utterly different — 
but it reminds me of looking across the valley at home

Nothing you see is the same — colour, skyline, cultivation, 
all different— and yet, for me anyway, the two countries 
have the same character D’you ever feel that? You think 
I’m mad about country You don’t feel it as I do My 
God,” he said, staring at the moors, “I’m glad I came to 
Enkendaal The Hague’s good enough for a few days, but 
I couldn’t live m a town ” 

It was true, it had the ring of truth, and Lewis perceived 
that Ballater’s passion for Nature, underlying the vanities 
with which he entertained the world, tormented while it 
delighted him, because he could find no way of expressing 
it ‘T can’t describe what I see I try to paint it sometimes 
— -just water-colour, you know It sounds damned silly, but 
I love it, though I dare say I’m no good I’ve never been 
taught,” he added, as if that were explanation enough 
“But I’ve been out sketching with Julie, and she says that 
with practice ” 

Vanity, having reasserted itself, was overcome by a re- 
collection that Julie had been quoted before “Look here, 
Alison We’ve got to live together When I begin to sing 
my own praises, you tell me What was the news m the 
Telegraaf this morning? I was m Enkendaal and didn’t see 
a paper ” 

“Nor did I,” Lewis admitted 

“Would you ever ? If I weren’t here, I believe you’d 
forget there was a war You’d drop out even the bulletins ” 

"No, I shouldn’t forget,” Lewis said, “but it’s true that 
the newspapers If I were m England,” he continued, 
“I should read them every morning and evening When 
we were first shut up in the fort, I read them And you 
remember the map Jedwell had on his wall — with pms, 
and red and green wool — I used to help him set it whenever 
there was a movement on the western front But even 
Jedwell gave up his map It isn’t indifference It isn’t just 
selfishness either ” 

And while Lewis was hesitating, Ballater said unex- 
pectedly “I know what you mean At least, I think I do 
You mean there’s something almost indecent m civilian 
keenness pms, and red and green wools like some damned

parlour game, or rushing in with a good bulletin as if it 
were the result of a steeplechase But one wants to 
know all the same ” 

“Here we are — shut up,” Lewis answered “We've 
given parole, we can't escape, we can't help m any way, 
even as civilians m England can help We are as much out 
of the world as if we were dead What we do or don't do 
makes no difference to a living soul As long as we live, we 
shall never again be responsible to ourselves alone And 
we don't know how long it will last — years perhaps, or 
Holland may come into the war next week and we find 
ourselves m the trenches the week after It gives me a 
feeling, as far as the war is concerned, of absolute fatalism 
This bit of our lives is in brackets — ours, our own as the 
rest of our lives can't be, and the bulletins and cartoons 
seem to belong to something outside the brackets ” 

They walked on in silence until Ballater exclaimed 
“But it makes things look pretty queer inside the brackets, 
Alison The more natural and ordinary a thing is, the 
harder it is to believe When I'm out sketching, it suddenly 
comes over me — ‘You oughtn't to be dabbing here with a 
brush,’ and I look at Julie — English, German officer's 
wife — telling me I have too much colour m my middle 
distance It's mad And these moors Listen to them So 
quiet you can hear the wind m the gorse — and there’s 
scarcely a breeze ” But suddenly Ballater became aware 
that he was floundering “Everything's back to front,” he 
abruptly concluded “It's no use thinking about it ” 

They said no more on this subject until, having made a 
wide circle over the moors, they were approaching the 
Castle by the avenue that skirted one bank of the lake 
“What your idea comes to,” Ballater remarked with 
relish, as if, while they walked, he had been turning a 
question over m his mind and had come unexpectedly on 
a pleasant answer to it, “is that, while we’re here, we can 
do as we like and damn the consequences ” 

“That sounds as though you had a plot?” Lewis an- 
swered 
“Plot?”

"It’s m your face ” 

“No — I — at least, I was only imagining ” He broke 

off, shot a laughing glance at Lewis to discover how much 
he had guessed, and added, with the mockery of a sigh 
“Anyhow, I don't believe the theory holds water I dare 
say we are irresponsible in a way Still, even here, one has 
to conform — up to a point Your sms find you out ” 

“Sms?” Lewis said “Oh, you mean women — is that 
it? I didn't say we were irresponsible, but that we were 
responsible only to ourselves ” 

“I don’t see the difference And if I was thinking 
of women — which I wasn't,” Ballater said, acknowledging 
his own lie in an unconcealed smile — “suppose one did 
have a go with some girl up here, well, wouldn’t that be 
inside the brackets, too? The thing wouldn’t drag on, as 
it would at home — women are liable to take everything 
seriously if they have the chance For ever and ever, amen 
But here there’d be no for ever and ever When we went 
back to England, that’d bring the curtain down short and 
sharp not that there are any women m Enkendaal, 
none to speak of any way ” 

The last denial, spoken with a forced easiness, showed 
to Lewis the direction of Ballater’s thoughts, but Julie’s 
name, which a swift impulse prompted him to speak, was 
checked on his lips by a momentary tension of his whole 
being, a shock of self-discovery, that made it impossible 
to speak of her And it would have been ridiculous to be 
angry, he told himself after a little while, for over Ballater’s 
mind thoughts of women passed like sunlight over water on 
a variable day, and, even if it had been Julie of whom he had 
been thinking, already he had ceased to think of her and 
was saymg in the anxious tone of a master of the cere- 
monies that, if the Baroness was out, they must turn down 
the comers of their cards But how many cards should 
they leave? The Baroness, her stepdaughter, Sophie, the 
old man himself — Ballater began to count them “Oh, 
and Julie, too, I suppose You know,” he added, “they 
have their own etiquette m this place We ought to have 
found out the details before we came ”

Their ignorance was not exposed At the point where 
the avenue ceased and the approach to the Castle widened 
into a great oval garden, walled for fruit trees on the curve 
farthest from the lakes, they were encountered by van 
Leyden himself, wearing gaiters and a faded black coat 
cut away short over his hips— a straight, wiry old man 
whose grey beard, trimmed to a long point, gave to his 
face an air of elaborate courtliness strangely contrasted 
with the plain, good-humoured, almost boyish intelligence 
of his eyes 

“So you have come, Mr Alison?” he began, speaking 
English smoothly and slowly as if he were translating his 
thought “And how do you find the cottage? I hope Kerst- 
holt looks after you Everyone is out, I believe,” he 
continued as they approached the house “But come m, 
come in, both of you Mr Ballater can tell me more about 
sugar-beet until the ladies return ” 

Ballater fell easily into the trap 

“About that idea of mine, sir ” he began 

Van Leyden chuckled “It doesn’t work, my good 
fnend I told Goof it wouldn’t — but Goof, he knows 
everything better than I do ” 

“But you said you’d never heard — were you pulling my 
leg, sir?” 

Ballater could laugh against himself and laughed now, 
but van Leyden, who had let slip his little joke uninten- 
tionally, ceased to chuckle, blaming himself, Lewis thought, 
for having allowed a foreigner to see that he had been 
making fun of him His apple cheeks tightened and his 
eyes twinkled above them, but he would not laugh He 
led the way into his own room — part sitting-room, part 
office — and gave his guests chairs and cigars Determined 
to put Ballater at his ease, he began to talk gravely of 
agriculture, pulling down records from his shelves, 
politely changing gulden to sterling when he mentioned 
prices, and never forgetting to ask questions about the 
Wiltshire acres Ballater leaned back in his chair and, 
having said with becoming modesty that, of course, every- 
thing at home was on a relatively small scale, talked, as

landowner to landowner, of the subject that warmed his 
heart and weighted his voice with importance The old 
man, his duty done, twisted a paper-weight and, with 
stolen glances towards the window, listened for the return 
of the women who would set him free 
“They ought to be home,” he said when a silence had 
fallen “Can't think what keeps them ” 

Lewis asked whether Julie also was out driving 
“Julie? I doubt it I wasn't thinking of her One never 
knows where she is She may be m the house somewhere ” 
It was spoken not unkindly but in such a tone as made it 
clear that, in van Leyden’s mmd, she was separate from 
his own family — little more than a lodger among them, 
and Lewis, while he drew the Baron on to talking of his 
library, asked himself how she lived m this castle — how 
the English child had grown up here She must have been 
lonely then, he thought, if she’s a lodger among them still 
“Julie promised to be a reader when she was a child,” 
he said out of his private thought 
“Ah, indeed Of course you knew her well m those days 
I suppose she went her own way then as now ” 

There was no interrogation m the Baron’s voice He 
was speaking only to cover his unwillingness to be re- 
minded of the time when his wife was not his wife What 
Julie had been he seemed not to care, perhaps his imagina- 
tion had never compassed her then or since She was not 
a van Leyden, and you did not become a van Leyden by 
nine years or by a lifetime spent among them And yet, 
Lewis thought, he speaks of her with a twinkling affec- 
tion, as though she were a pretty toy that it amused him 
to have on his shelf 

The Baron’s first wife had been his cousin Allard, 
married now and heir to Enkendaal, Sophie who lived on 
unwedded and of whom Ballater had given a sour report, 
Jan who was m the Legation at Washington, Goof at the 
Huis ten Borgh — all these were her children, doubly van 
Leyden, but Mrs Quillan had once been Mejuffrouw 
- Hoek, the governess of Allard and Sophie — and Julie was 
that governess’s alien daughter Alien not by birth only,

but m will and mood, Lewis thought, looking into the 
heavy intelligence of van Leyden’s face, which, though 
evidently that of a man skilled m his own business, had 
m repose, when there was no glint of laughter to quicken 
it, the dullness of a close and stubborn mind Above it, 
on a wall of red and gold embossed leather that was 
being turned by the years into a general black, hung three 
portraits m gilt frames — the portraits, beyond doubt, of 
three earlier van Leydens In this room, they also had 
dropped pipe ash or snuff on to estate ledgers and done 
the patriarchal business of a burgomaster of Enkendaal 
They differed m feature, no common physical mark, un- 
less perhaps the outward turning of their ears, pronounced 
that they were of one family, but relationship was as plain 
in their expressions as m the lip of the Hapsburgs There 
was a woodenness common to them all, a strange mingling 
of toughness and benign irritability Jealous of their rights, 
but without the spirit for tyranny, rulers but not leaders, 
solid, competent, enduring, dull, they had been masters 
of Enkendaal because, recognizing their limitations, they 
had not looked beyond it And yet, had there not been a 
van Leyden who resisted the Spaniards and died m re- 
sistance? “Willem van Leyden,” Lewis asked, “did he 
live at Enkendaal?” 

“Which Willem — Long Ears?” 

“The one the Spanish burned ” 

“Ah 1 the Leyden martyr* No, he didn’t live here, except 
for a few months when he was a boy The Huis ten Borgh 
was his — a fine place m those days, but the Spanish — how 
do you say verwoesterft — plunder? sack? — the Spanish 
sacked it Willem lost everything — his money, his house, 
his life Did you know his mother was Scottish?” the old 
man added, as if that were needed to explain his ancestor’s 
rashness “And m the Scottish mother there was a streak 
of French — not a safe mixture, eh?” 

“Not safe?” 

“Well, your Stuarts couldn’t keep their thrones or their 
heads for ten minutes What is the use of having a thing 
if you don’t keep it, and do good with it, and make it

grow?” He picked up another cigar and bit it “The Fes- 
tons,” he added suddenly after a gap of thought, “have 
France and Scotland m their blood ” 

Lewis did not answer this, for it seemed to invite no 
answer Julie’s grandmother had been a Feston, daughter 
of the fourth Marquess of Harbury Where France and 
Scotland entered into the pedigree, Lewis did not know, 
but van Leyden knew and had remembered, m speaking 
of Julie’s descent, he had given his explanation of her — 
a convenient explanation, this dangerous mixing of blood, 
which, when once he had seized upon it, perhaps nine 
years ago, had answered with a magic formula many of the 
questions that she might otherwise have provoked He had 
had no need to ask himself more about her than he might 
have asked about a pet animal of alien breed Naturally 
incurious, hating the labour of imagination, he had allowed 
France and Scotland to absolve him from it 

In this rigidity of mind, which was implicit m his tone 
when he spoke of Julie, there was an element so masterful 
that Lewis could at once smile at and admire it It was the 
defect of a quality without which neither van Leyden him- 
self nor his ancestors on the walls could have been the men 
they were — men capable of cutting distractions out of their 
lives as a gardener cuts out weeds, thus enabling the narrow 
plots of their activity to be sturdy, ordered and fruitful 
But to live with such a man and m a world commanded 
by him ? 

I could live with him, Lewis thought I should admire 
him as I always admire men, even the dullest, who know 
their job and keep their noses to the grindstone And he 
found himself envying the rebels in life, not only the great 
rebels whose rebellion was justified by genius but even 
the rash, mistaken, foolish ones, who cut such a sorry figure 
m the world A queer envy m him* In the past he had 
always been inclined to draw satisfaction from the rash 
failures of little men who had overshot their mark and be- 
come ridiculous, to smile at them had been to console him- 
self at his own grindstone, to approve his own caution, to 
read modesty and virtue mto it And lately, though he had

learned not to sneer at failure, he had condemned rebellion 
for another reason — that it was the contrary of acceptance, 
which had become for him the rule of life that he most 
desired to receive Why, then, when he thought of Julie 
living with the van Leydens, did he envy her those qualities 
of sparkling, wayward vitality which she must have paid 
for with unhappiness? Little could she have gained by 
them Unable to answer his question, and wondering at 
himself that he should envy what reason told him was 
not enviable, he passed suddenly through one of those 
blank spaces of thought wherein a blinding flash of the 
mind banishes an old subject and admits a new, seemingly 
inconsequent If she were here now, he thought, she'd be 
huddled m this chair and despise me as she despises van 
Leyden, or respect me as she may respect him — or, no, 
not despise, not respect, but pity, with a mocking, con- 
temptuous, affectionate pity She is young If she were in 
this chair, her suppleness would conform to it, when she 
rose, she would move with a weightless rhythm, as if drawn 
into the air But I shall drag my feet in, throw my weight 
forward, pitch myself up with a thrust of my hands If I 
played Rugger still, I should be a veteran He remembered 
the hands which beside the lake she had thrust into his — 
the spring of the fingers, the interior softness, the run of 
the blood He saw his own, lying on the leather before 
him He had always been a little proud of them — long, 
chiselled revealing the bone But the skin at the knuckles 
was losing its elasticity, the nails were drying, soon these 
would be the hands of middle age With what aloofness 
she would consider them and him 1 He was set He was 
grave and set Like a puppy, she would amuse herself by 
teasing his gravity And yet Ten years, he said, ten years 
isn't so much To be thirty is to be young — van Leyden 
would say so 1 But he could not persuade himself In her 
view, he was not her ally — rather, in solid gravity, van 
Leyden's “My schoolmaster 1 ” she had said, “My school- 
master 1 '' 

He lifted his hands out of his sight and grasped the back 
of his chair

Van Leyden was hoisting himself With compelled vigour 
he crossed the room and dragged at a silken bell-rope be- 
side the hearth In answer to the bell, a butler entered, 
dressed like an English gardener m Sunday black, but 
wearing white cotton gloves 

“Tea ” 

It was brought on a large silver tray Among the tea 
things was a dish of fruit, and van Leyden, when his guests 
were served, began to eat an apple with slow, munching 
satisfaction, and to talk to Ballater, who was instantly away 
m the Wiltshire orchards, of the cultivation of fruit, almost 
whining in his impatience while Ballater’s discourse con- 
tinued but becoming benign again as soon as he had estab- 
lished an interruption He gave his own views loudly and 
slowly, as if he were uncertain whether he could be under- 
stood, shaking his head now and then over some perversity 
of Ballater’s like a hairy dog that is irritated by water 
dripping over its eyes From apples to the library, of whose 
ancient contents he was exceedingly proud, from the library 
to crops, from crops to horses, from horses to pedigrees, 
from pedigrees — but from that subject he never strayed 
very far, men, horses and apples being rooted m it Con- 
versation dragged on A map was spread over Ballater’s 
knees, van Leyden’s voice and his scraping forefinger were 
explaining it Clouds gathered over the sun, which would 
not appear again that day Outside the long window a 
cluster of rhododendron bushes was growing stiff m the 
quietened light, on the lowest pane a sparrow, perched on 
the framework, was scratching and tapping with its beak 

Staring at the sky above the bushes, a calm, vaporous 
sky, glazed yet, where the clouds were unfolded, with 
winter’s transparent steel, Lewis fell back from the self- 
examination that had lately disturbed him into an un- 
troubled repose, upon which the clock, the slow pendulum, 
the little activity of the sparrow, the crackling canvas of 
the map were, now and then, delicious accents In the 
midst of this quietness he became aware that, standing 
"behind him, Julie had laid her hands upon his He lifted 
his face She was stooping over him, her expression a 



ch ii THE CASTLE 97 

laughing demand for silence None had heard her enter, 
Ballater and van Leyden were close upon their map, like 
a child she would surprise them For an instant, while she 
hung above him, he was admitted to conspiracy with her, 
and her hands, warm from their gloves, communicated 
- with a firm pressure her urgent secrecy — communicated to 
him, yielded to him, a light, exquisite, eager confidence 
It was as if she had poured her own youth into him, as if, 
by her failure to perceive that rigidity of his mind which, 
he had supposed, separated him from her, she had given 
him her own suppleness, admitting him by a recognition 
of kinship with herself to a life that he had believed to be 
dead 

For a moment, having no thought but of wonder and 
pleasure, he did not attempt to rise, and, when he would 
have risen, she held him in his place, moving her head and 
smiling “Don’t let them know yet that I am here,” she 
seemed to say Indeed, her lips moved as though she were 
whispering, but no sound came from them, and Lewis, 
seeing her face above him and from so unusual an angle, 
felt the wings of unreality touch the instant as if, m the 
fulness of a dream, he were on the edge of a discovery that 
he was dreaming It was an experience less than thought, 
more fragile and elusive than accepted feeling — a gleam 
of magic instantly lost, but to him, who had for long be- 
lieved himself to be shut out from the lustre of such en- 
chantments, it brought an inexpressible delight — the rapt 
but momentary ecstasy of one who has imagined m him- 
self again the breath of an expectation long since aban- 
doned, of an emotion forgotten and put away 

Van Leyden now looked over his shoulder and said 
briefly m Dutch “Just come in?” before turning to the 
map again But the map was gone, Ballater had risen, all 
smiles Soon the three of them were on their feet before 
her 

“I’ve been here ages,” she said, “watching* You didn’t 
know, did you?” 

“No,” said van Leyden “But what if we had?” 

“What if you had? Nothing, I suppose Except that I

might have stabbed you m the back, Uncle Pieter, before 
you had a chance to growl at me ” 

“GrowP” said van Leyden “What do you expect me 
to do ? Dance, because you have come into the room ? ” 

She was talking to Ballater, while van Leyden, with 
stiff knees and lower lip thrust out, rocked from foot to 
foot before the fireplace, looking at Lewis now and then 
and making a little grimace as if to say, “Yes, I know I 
was sharp with her, but she gets on my nerves She’s like 
quicksilver ” Lewis, watching her enjoyment of Ballater’s 
easy company, felt, not jealousv, but a slow humiliation 
It was not that he was now excluded from her in tima cy 
but that he had ever supposed himself to have been ad- 
mitted to it The excitement of a moment ago was gone 
There had been after all no significance m the chance of 
her having shared a childish joke with him Whoever had 
happened to be sitting m that chair by the door, she would 
have leaned over him and made him her partner m secrecy 
When she might have a free choice of the man with whom 
she would talk, it was to Ballater she went So be it 
Ballater was closer to her in years 

She was sitting on the corner of a leather fenderstool, 
looking up, her head thrown back, her lips parted Ballater 
having pretended to scold her for some imagined wrong- 
doing, the colour moved in her cheeks while she answered 
him and her eyes shone, but suddenly her eyes came round 
to Lewis, lingered in some provocative curiosity that he 
could not interpret, and were turned away She raised her 
voice, Ballater broke into laughter, she joined m it, the 
room, seemingly, was theirs Why this little arrogance of 
behaviour — this defiance of the quiet of van Leyden’s own 
place? It was contrary to her breeding, and Lewis had 
begun in his mind to blame her for it when he perceived 
that it was not deliberate Embarrassment had touched 
her, this was her unchosen way of release from it 
“I’m sorry, Uncle Pieter,” she said “I’ve invaded your 
territory ” 

* He looked at her with puzzled good-humour “I don’t 
know what’s the matter with you to-day You’re usually

quiet as silk m here D’you know,” he went on, turning to 
Lewis, “she used to come to this room when she was a 
child and curl up m that chair and sit like a mouse for 
hours God knows why I must have been dull company ” 
“I thought you might talk to me,” she replied “You 
-never did ” 

“Well,” said van Leyden, “what was there to talk to 
you about?” 

Ballater, seeing that her face was changed, had knotted 
his brow, her seriousness perplexed him He tried to draw 
her from it, but his light-hearted question missed its mark 
She was staring at the armchair towards which van Leyden 
had pointed and from it raised her eyes to the window in a 
long abstracted look Then, with a little wrench of her 
whole body, she roused herself and was Ballater’s again 
The cloud had passed, van Leyden had not perceived it, 
his hand was on Lewis’s arm 
“Come,” he said “I promised to show you the library 
since you’re interested m such things We can leave these 
children to amuse themselves ” 


The tower, van Leyden explained as they crossed the 
hall, had been greatly changed since it was built, or, rather, 
not the tower itself, but the approaches to it, for it had 
survived a fire at the end of the eighteenth century by 
which a great part of the old castle had been gutted Only 
the topmost storey could be reached by the main staircase 
The lowest — “we dme there when there’s a big party” — 
was approached through the drawing-rooms and a long 
series of passages and antechambers Thence a stair built 
into the thickness of the wall led up into the library 

“The stair stops here?” said Lewis when they stood in 
the great circular room 

Van Leyden pointed to an oak door opposite that by 
which they had entered 

“There used to be another wall-stair going upward But 
it’s black and slippery — none too safe Not used now 
Nor is the library, if it comes to that ”

Cleaners and housemaids came here, but none came to 
read The books and shelves bore no accumulation of 
dust, the thick carpet gave out its faded colours, a broad 
central table, a reading-stand and a couple of shelf ladders 
had been lately polished, a group of padlocked boxes, of 
the kind seen m lawyers’ rooms, gleamed still, though 
their black enamel had been dulled by the years, but there 
was no sign of common usage On the table stood a dried 
mkpot, an empty pen-tray, a pink blotting-pad whitened 
by age, a wooden bowl of rusted pins Two of the three 
window embrasures, each the size of a small room hewn 
out of the stone, had been used for miscellaneous storage 
dead toys were there, dead skates, a canoe, dead games m 
battered cardboard boxes, a woman’s bicycle with the 
broken strings of its skirt-guard dangling m a melancholy 
fringe over its spokes 

Van Leyden put his hand on the bicycle with clumsy 
timidity A sentiment, not a happy one, seemed to compel 
his movement, the machine had over him some power of 
association to which he would not confess While he 
touched it, he pretended not to know that he was touching 
it and with his other hand waved Lewis’s attention else- 
where But, his thumb catching the lip of the bell, he 
could not forbear to press it There was a grinding sound, 
weak and toneless, as if a mile away some little, rusty gate 
had moved on its hinges 

“Kapot” he said 

A thick word that had become ludicrous, for when a 
thing was broken that urgently needed repair, Dutch 
servants would always stare hopelessly at it and say that 
it was kapot m a slack, indifferent tone which implied that 
no one would ever be fool enough to mend it Kapot and 
morgen , the formulae of blank resignation and perpetual 
postponement, had seemed to the English officers to be 
national phrases of the Dutch, and, hearing one of them 
spoken by van Leyden as an epitaph on his first wife’s 
bicycle, Lewis had to turn swiftly towards the shelves to 
conceal the twitching of his lips 

Van Leyden did his utmost to be a good host m this

treasure-house of his He pointed to a few volumes of 
conspicuous value, rehearsed dutifully what others had 
told him of them, admitted at last, with a contraction of 
his shoulders and an apologetic movement of his hands, 
that he was not competent to be a guide “I had an uncle, 
-my father’s younger brother — Dirk van Leyden — he’d 
have told you Used to sit here all day, writing, writing, 
writing Those tm boxes are full of his stuff You look 
at it some day — all sorts Verse even He sat at that table 
There’s his mkpot You see where the carpet’s worn thin? 
He used to shuffle his feet ” 

“What did he write?” Lewis asked 
“Oh — ah — all sorts,” van Leyden repeated “There 
was a professor from Leiden came here once m my father’s 
time He wanted to publish some of it but my father 
wouldn’t let him ” 

“Why?” 

“Family history ” 

“You feel as he did?” 

“The less one says, the less chance one gives to some 
scribbler who isn’t one of us ” 

“Then it was good of you to say I might see it ” 

“You? But you are not Dutch It would give you no 
satisfaction to discover some little thing about us and 
build it up and build it up” — van Leyden spread out his 
hands — “until every school teacher in the country could 
purse her lips whenever our name was spoken, and shake 
her finger and put her eyebrows into her forehead — och, 
you don’t know how much interest they take in us* You 
English are different You have no curiosity about people’s 
grandmothers You might be better if you had more of it — 
but not too much, not too much You forget too quick, we 
remember too long ” 

He touched the tm cases with the toe of his boot “It’s 
not all uncle Dirk’s,” he said “There are other manu- 
scripts as well Some of Mary Stuart’s letters — the wife 
of William of Orange You are welcome, if you wish to see 
them Then I’ll get the key ” 

Lewis would have stayed him, another journey by the

tower-stair was an undertaking for so old a man But van 
Leyden brushed him aside “No trouble, no trouble,” he 
said, and evidently he wished to go — for courtesy’s sake, 
perhaps, no service to a guest being troublesome to a van 
Leyden, but also, Lewis suspected, because the library 
bored him and he was glad of an excuse to leave a book- 
worm to a solitary examination of it 
The library changed when he was gone out, as human 
beings change and reveal new qualities in themselves when 
they are freed of company that is a restraint upon them, 
and Lewis found that the room itself had a value for him 
independent of the books contained m it He was not a 
connoisseur of rare volumes It was the patience of books 
that he loved, their absolute passivity, which endured all 
things in man It was a miracle that a book, neglected for 
years, being taken down at last, should smg instantly with 
Shelley’s voice and that the voice should be unchanged by 
all the operations of fortune And if, while he read the 
argument of a master, his attention should wander from 
it and drift away into his own follies or prides, to this 
master he might return unreproved as to no other, books 
having no need to forgive The argument would be con- 
tinued, if he misunderstood, he could turn back and it 
would be repeated — endlessly repeated without irritation, 
without scorn, if he rejected it, he might lay it aside and 
it would not intrude itself, would not complain or threaten 
or protest It was the godlike aloofness of books that he 
loved But, as the word godlike struck upon his mind, he 
thought But we have made gods m our own image, they 
are angry or merciful, they pardon or condemn, and he 
remembered how, when he was a small boy, being m some 
way disgraced before his family and having no one to 
whom he might turn, he had found an Irish terrier curled 
up on the stairs in a patch of sunlight and had flung his 
arms round its neck and wept “Alison, Cheppmg” — he 
saw again the engraving on the collar and felt the wiry 
hair on his cheek His comfort then had been, not in any 
♦godlike quality, but m the blessed inhumanity of dogs, 
m the terrier’s absolute detachment, more healing than

tolerance or pity, from the worldly confusion into which 
the small boy had fallen The blessed inhumanity of books! 
he said to himself now That must be their secret for me 
Yet their inhumanity must not be coldness, it must be a 
transcending of the heat of life which still dwells m them 
"as the heat of the sun may be said to dwell m an oak tree 
And though, just now, I thought that I loved this room 
better than the books contained in it, without the books 
it would be cold, it would be a tomb I couldn’t walk up 
and down, up and down, feeling this silence enclose me 
like wings When I stood still, listening, it would be lone- 
liness, not solitude, that enfolded me 
He began to ask himself whether long ago, m some 
forgotten dream, he had visited this room, for he seemed 
now, not to have come, but to have returned, to it If he 
had dreamed of it, how had the dream continued? Well, 
he thought, struggling against an overpowering mood, 
dream or no dream, I know how reality will continue, the 
Baron will come back with the key — and there is his step* 
But van Leyden did not appear, and the force of indefin- 
able expectation resumed its sway over Lewis until he 
knew that the moment through which he was living was 
a gate between a life and a life Yet he was not unquiet, 
rather did he seem to have entered the innermost court of 
quietness itself, where, like a stream from the ground, a 
fountain of the spirit was rising He understood that he 
would come again and again to this place, and watch the 
hours and seasons circle about its walls, and find, if he had 
constancy enough, such peace as he might carry always 
within him through the world 
Perceiving how much of fate the room held for him, 
how suddenly all the dreams of his life had been gathered 
together m it to be betrayed or fulfilled, he looked at it 
anew as a man will look into the face of the bride to whom 
his irretrievable pledge is given The lofty ceiling, the 
prodigious thickness of wall, the long vertical shafts of 
light diffusing themselves at the mouths of the embrasures 
and throwing upon the inner shelves a pallid, web-like 
gleam that might have been the earliest evidence of a new

day — these had lately been strange to him, he trembled 
now before their intimacy But why am I trembling? So 
a monk might tremble, seeing his cell after his final vows 
had been taken But this is no cell, I am no monk This is a 
room m which, with van Leyden’s permission, I shall 
work No more than that The old battle between his 
aspiration and the humility to which he had trained him- 
self was refought m his mind, he shied away from his own 
vision, telling himself that the intimations which had 
swept his being were the intimations of a saint and, there- 
fore, presumptuous, unnatural, deceptive in him Let no 
man be hasty to eat of the fruits of paradise before his 
time, Jeremy Taylor had said It was a warning to ordinary 
men not to mistake emotion for vision, a warning that he 
would do well to accept He accepted it now without false- 
ness, recognizing his own limitations, but the thought that 
the solitude of this room Was pregnant with discoveries 
for him persisted, and he did not seek to repel or deny it 
I shall be alone here I shall pursue my task and thread 
all my hours on it It will not be, perhaps, a contemplative 
life that I shall lead, contemplation is too high a word 
But I shall have a single mind, and no single mind is 
barren 

At peace with himself and seeing his way before him, 
he went to one of the windows and looked out upon the 
lakes At the end of the farther lake, where the curving 
drive passed out mto the road, a bare-headed woman was 
standing on the bank — a motionless figure crowned with 
a fleck of white Beyond the gate a loaded cart came down 
from the woods, went on its way towards Enkendaal, and 
was presently lost among the trees at the roadside The 
white-haired woman vanished mto her lodge In all the 
scene there was no human sound or movement, no move- 
ment but a shudder of the water now and then and a 
ruffling of the trees, no sound but of the little waterfall 
which, being near the foot of the tower, sent up its soft 
plash and purr to the windows 

• Above the fall, the upper lake stretched away to the 
right A great expanse of water, it curved round the tower

and was cut off from view at last by the masonry of the 
Castle Over it afternoon had begun to fade m a starless 
sky Though twilight had not yet come, the distinguishing 
forms of the clouds were dimmed, and the low, wooded 
hill on the opposite bank, from which Lewis had looked 
out on the previous evening, was losing its foreground 
Among the darkening shrubs green shone here and there 
with a sad brilliance, and on the eyot, when a breeze lifted 
the foliage, little tongues of yellow and green flame appeared 
to move over the branches The eyot would be doubly 
beautiful when autumn came Flames would burn m it, 
and beneath a late sun of October the water be fired by 
them 

Remembering that the earth was at war and that when 
October’s sun was on the lake he might not be there to see 
it, Lewis discovered an intense bliss m the quietness of the 
scene before him A veil was drawn between him and all 
things external to this scene He thought of the war as if 
it had been fought long ago and of his mother and sisters 
as people who had once played their part m the village his- 
tory of Chepping Imagination of them brought into his 
mind another face, the face of a girl standing before him 
with tears m her eyes and her lip twisted by a grief she 
could not control Elizabeth he said the name aloud He 
tried to imagine what she might be doing now and to re- 
prove himself for having written to her so seldom while 
he was m the fort, and then only to thank her for having 
packed his books and to answer her letters after long inter- 
vals But he could not reconcile her with the present, her 
letters seemed to have been written by a ghost to a ghost 
Nothing of her remained but the tears she had at last been 
unable to check and had been too miserable to conceal They 
had rolled down her face, which she had not turned away 
The recollection of her frozen agony cut him — but like the 
recollection of a scene m a tragic play witnessed long ago 
Her love and their parting belonged to a dead life, and the 
time m which she had lived for him was faded — was faded 
as his old self was fading while he looked down upon the 
lakes Here all confusions will be taken from me I am

alone I am alone, he repeated as if by repetition of 
the word he could ensure the privacy of his soul 
When, beneath the tower window, two small figures ap- 
peared on the peninsula and moved out towards the boat- 
house, his mind was slow to accept their presence, and it 
was with the reluctance of a sleeper awakening from a 
dream that he identified them Ballater and Julie They 
were climbing into a boat Ballater was going home by the 
short way across the upper lake, he would disembark on 
the opposite bank, wave to her, disappear among the trees, 
she would bring the boat back Lewis watched them with- 
out disturbance — the little figures, the toy boat, the ringed 
puddles where Ballater lazily dipped his blades 
But they went up the lake, not across it, and, as soon 
as they were lost to sight, Lewis’s mmd began to hunger 
after them He thought of the air moving on their faces, 
the stiff throb of the rowlocks, the cut of water under the 
boat Soon Ballater would cease to row, and, resting on his 
oars, would look up at the Castle and speak to her She 
would dabble her hand and shake the drops from it on 
to the opaque surface of the lake “Cold 1 ” Lewis imagined 
her tone and how there would be a rim of coldness on the 
warm flesh of her wrist Last night I kissed her hand, he 
said, and flinched He saw her again leaning over the back 
of his chair, her breasts had touched his hands, there had 
been a moving pulse m the cup of her throat 
The library, when he turned back into it, was dark and 
unquiet He was glad when van Leyden entered, carrying 
before him a readmg lamp of fluted silver and over his wrist 
a pair of keys joined by a fragile chain 



CHAPTER THREE 

Lewis and his host came down from the library and 
through the antechambers side by side In the drawing- 
room a maid was closing the shutters and a youth in an 
alpaca jacket and felt shoes held a taper m his hand 

Van Leyden snapped at him m Dutch “Not the candles, 
Willem Two lamps, no more Oil may be short before 
long ” 

“Mevrouw ” Willem began 

“Nonsense Take your orders from me And listen 
The English officer is to use the library when he pleases 
Sometimes morning, sometimes afternoon See there are 
pens, ink, paper — everything What else do you need, 
Alison?” 

“A waste-paper basket,” said Lewis in English, his 
Dutch failing him 

“ Prullenmand De jonkheer is schnjver Twee prullen- 

manden ” 

“ Goed , Mi]nheer ” 

Van Leyden, who still held m his hand the silver lamp 
he had carried into the library, was moving towards the 
door when he jibbed and turned aside, pretending a sudden 
interest m a Troyon that hung on the wall 

“Give them time to get upstairs,” he said, and Lewis, 
glancing m the direction of his alarm, saw a group of three 
standing by a long table m the hall, greyly illuminated by 
the dusk of high windows The Baroness and Sophie were 
returned, the butler was attending them Where was Anna* 
Why was she not there to take their wraps* the elder

woman was asking, while the younger stood aside, grim 
and silent, with a bleak, curling smile on her lips 

Sophie despises this usurper who was her governess, 
Lewis said at once to himself, and he imagined that behind 
the slanting eyes and prompting the curled smile was the 
thought Old Jacob, too, remembers when she was Juffrouw 
Hoek But Sophie was too proud to give Jacob the con- 
fidence of her glance and he was engrossed by his vam 
wish to conciliate the Baroness, holding out his arms like 
white-gloved clothes rails while she piled her belongings 
upon him 

“Who?” she was heard to say while the Troyon was 
being examined and the group m the hall was lost to sight 
“Who? Why can't you speak up, Jacob?” 

“I heard clearly,” said Sophie's voice “Jacob was 
reporting, Ella, that the two English officers had called ” 

“Have they gone, Jacob?” 

“They weren't seen to go, Mevrouw ” 

“Where are they, then?” 

“One went to the library with mijnheer, Mevrouw w 

“And the other?” 

There was a pause Jacob seemed to be recovering him- 
self Was he hesitating to say that Julie had gone with 
Ballater on to the lake? Though Julie was not van Leyden, 
Lewis did not doubt that the sympathy of the men- 
servants would be with her 

“Perhaps the other went back to Kerstholt’s cottage, 
Mevrouw ” 

“Odd” cried the Baroness It was the noise made by a 
small puma before it is sick “You are so stupid, Jacob 
You say one thing and the other Questioning you about 
the simplest thing is like — but why are we m the dark? 
Didn't I tell you that the silver lamp was to stand always 
in the hall, on this table?” 

“Ja, Mevrouw ” 

“Where, then, where? How do you expect other servants 
to obey when you — I'm beginning to think you are getting 
past your work If you cannot remember ” 

“Here's the lamp Here's the lamp, Ella,” van Leyden

called He turned away from the Troyon, whinneymg 
annoyance into the roll of his moustache so that the grey 
hairs reared themselves under his nose 4 4 Baiting the serv- 
ants like that Baiting ” Lewis heard him murmur as he 
went out into the hall “Here’s the lamp, my dear, I took 
it into the library to show Dirk’s papers to Mr Alison ” 

Lewis was introduced to Sophie A gently venomous 
woman, he thought at first, then — but a pitiable one, and 
venomous only because she knows that she is pitiable She 
gave him a hard, limp hand, too old a hand for one whose 
years could not be more than thirty-five, could not be 
more, for the Baroness was forty-five and had been Sophie’s 
governess Sophie gave him a forced smile which said 
“It’s useless to smile at you You won’t like me either I’ve 
too much experience to hope that you will ” So grey was 
she (though her hair was black and without gloss — like a 
negress’s hair, but straight and smooth), so grey and tall 
and shabby, that she made him think of a long moleskin 
coat on a hanger, worn and moulted “Your friend has 
gone home?” was all she said “That’s a pity ” And 
long afterwards, with a flash of the whites of her eyes, she 
asked her father “And where’s Julie, I wonder?” 

The Baroness held Lewis’s hands between hers In the 
van Leyden tradition of hospitality she was welcoming a 
guest to the castle of which she was mistress, and again 
Sophie’s lips began to curl Lewis was glad when his hand 
was released How cleverly, m an attempt to preserve her 
youth, the Baroness had preserved everything except 
youth itself — the yellow hair, the glistening teeth, the 
tight flesh, even the tone of girlish eagerness that her voice 
could still summon “You must come to tea When? To- 
morrow? Thursday, perhaps? And on Sophie’s birthday 
you must both dme here ” 

As Lewis walked down to the lodge, he saw Julie rowing 
across the lake alone Ballater must have landed on the 
opposite bank and would be home before him 

That night, m his bedroom, he turned and returned the 
pages of the Phaedo until his candle overflowed its bowl,

for he wished to observe again, and observe closely, how 
Socrates pursued the theme of the spirit’s detachment from 
the flesh, which had dominated his own mind in the library 
of the Castle It seemed at first that Socrates was at fault 
Thought was best, he argued, when she took leave of the 
body and had no bodily sense or desire, and he added that 
a true philosopher must have a firm conviction that only 
after death might he find wisdom m her purity This was 
good reason that a philosopher should welcome death, but 
was it equally good reason, as Socrates appeared to believe, 
that a man, while living, should struggle continually to 
separate soul from body — “to live as nearly as he can m 
a state of death?” For if separation of soul from body 
was impossible in this world, as Socrates himself allowed, 
would not the body, crying out against the stress of at- 
tempted separation, become a more conspicuous part of 
consciousness than when the impossible detachment was 
not attempted? 

Folding the book against him and leaning back on his 
pillow, Lewis wondered what the answer of Socrates 
would be “Each man must strike his balance between soul 
and body according to his nature,” Socrates might say, 
but this reply would be m conflict with his own argument 
that men should study “to live as nearly as they can m a 
state of death ” For, to live m a state of death, Lewis 
thought, is to seek not a middle way, but an extreme, it is 
to separate and unbalance, not to balance, the soul and 
the body In this Socrates is an extremist, he said, picking 
up the book, and runs on the same path with mediaeval 
asceticism 

Was that true? He looked out across the dark room 
questiomngly, as though the philosopher were before him 
and he might read his face He felt that he had been arro- 
gant, and must certainly have been blind, m thus disputing 
with one whom it was necessary only to understand How 
often before had he, w common with Socrates’s own disciples, 
imagined that he had his master m a corner’ He turned 
back the pages that he might follow the argument again, 
and, as he read, he saw that there were indeed logical dis-

in 


crepancies in it, but that its wisdom survived its faults, as a 
great character survives its errors If I compare phrase with 
phrase, he said, I am led astray by the opposition of words, 
the words soul and body having such a cloud of meaning 
attached to them as darkens their use Words are elastic 
'symbols, they yield differently to differing tensions of 
thought, and though I may imagine that I can trip Socrates 
with a quibble, it is I who fall, not he, for his intention is 
plain — that each man ought to cultivate “the habit of the 
soul gathering and collecting herself into herself from all 
sides out of the body, the dwelling in her own place alone, 
as in another life, so also m this as far as she can ” That 
last phrase, “as far as she can,” marks the difference be- 
tween Socrates and the mediaeval ascetics To them the 
body was evil, they schooled themselves to hate and destroy 
it, and, finding that it was indestructible except by death, 
they allowed their hatred of the supposed evil to grow 
until it became a corruption of the cherished good To 
Socrates the body, though often evil m its effects, was 
not of itself evil, it was evil only m dominance, it was 
to be mastered, not destroyed, and the problem of a good 
life was that of learning how to subdue the body while it 
lived 

That, Lewis thought, is the doctrine of Socrates as 
nearly as I can understand it, and he put out his candle 
and lay down, believing that he was ready to sleep But 
his mind remained active, slowly approximating philo- 
sophic debate to his personal life and relating it to emotions 
of which he was scarcely aware The argument of Socrates 
seemed to depend upon two things — first, upon belief in 
the immortality of the soul, and, if that were assumed, then 
upon a belief that body and soul were opposed to each 
other The first belief is implanted in me, Lewis thought, 
I could not if I would, rid myself of it, but I am not per- 
suaded that soul and body are in opposition 

Is it not possible, he asked himself as he lay in darkness, 
that the body is an instrument of the soul, not merely a 
limitation upon it that we must study to outgrow? Is 
human love a limitation upon the souP Socrates seemed 



112 


THE FOUNTAIN 


H 


to think so, for he said the body “fills us full of love and 
lusts, and fears, and fancies of all kinds, and endless 
foolery ” Endless foolery 1 Lewis wanted to ask Socrates 
Is it not possible that the Body is too inclusive a word 
and that we ought rather to think of bodily things as 
being of two kinds — those bodily things that serve the 
flesh only, and those that serve the soul as well as the 
flesh ? The first kind ought indeed to be subordinated, 
the mind ought not to be given to them, like the acts 
of breathing and walking, they should produce neither 
pleasure nor pam nor any awareness of themselves But 
the second kind are the contributions of this life to the 
growth of the soul and, though they ought to be regarded 
not as of themselves valuable but as being of a contribu- 
tory value only, we ought not to despise them or confuse 
them with the first kind And it is part of the duty of a 
philosopher to decide what bodily things are of the first 
kind, spiritually valueless, and what of the second kind, 
spiritually contributory And I would say that human love 
is sometimes of one kind, sometimes of the other Nor is 
the distinction by any means made clear by the presence 
or absence of carnal desire A mother’s love for her child 
is not, within her consciousness, carnal, but it may never- 
theless be a love that occupies her mind with earthly 
aspirations and prevents the growth of her soul, if so, 
however selfless, it may be without spiritual value And 
a man’s love for a woman, though one of the expressions 
of it be carnal, may be the very air m which his soul grows 
The distinction is hard, so hard that, in making it, reason 
combats experience, instances appear that contend with 
every rule, and we fall back at last upon intuition, choosing 
to make our way by the sun of poetry rather than by the 
map of argument 

He passed the next day and the next m desultory read- 
ing and speculation at ease, content that, while he wandered 
alone through the countryside, his mind should take what 
course it would It was as if he were a very young man full 
of opportunities and unfettered in his choice of a way of

life Leisure and freedom, coming to him now after he had 
supposed that they had passed him by or that he, in years 
and responsibility, had stiffened beyond the enjoyment of 
them, brought with them the wonder of a miracle, and 
again and again he would be delighted, not by the fruit of 
thought, but by the discovery that thought had become 
his natural companion Ballater, returning from the Huis 
ten Borgh or from a sketching expedition with Julie, would 
ask “What have you been doing all day' 5 ” and, being 
answered with the truth, say that if Lewis had been 
writing a book or reading for an examination he could 
have understood this determined solitude, but that as it 
was 

“What on earth do you do with yourself?” he asked 

But Ballater could be tolerant of a friend who differed 
from himself and was amused and made curious by 
Lewis’s drifting way 

“Julie wanted to come m here with me,” he said one 
evening “She has an idea that you’re hiding from every- 
one I told her she’d better leave you alone ” 

“What did she say to that?” 

“She laughed and asked why — were you asleep?” 

“And you said?” 

“That as far as I could make out you were m some kind 
of a dream of your own Anyhow I kept her out I was 
right, wasn’t I? You don’t want her m here?” 

Lewis said yes, he had been right, but, hearing in 
imagination how Ballater and Julie had laughed together 
over him, he understood that his drifting was perilous, 
and determined that henceforth he would pursue regularly 
the task that had engaged him in the fort But he was still 
without an established routine of scholarship as he walked 
with Ballater to the Castle on the evening of Sophie’s 
birthday 

“Why are you so determined to keep Julie out of the 
cottage?” Ballater asked “You don’t dislike her?” 

“No I don’t dislike her ” 

“Weil?” 

Against his reason, beyond his knowledge of himself, a

defensive anger stirred in Lewis “Why did she want to 
come in*” he cried “She’s shallow and vain and cruel 
Why on earth should she want to disturb me*” 

Ballater stared and laughed “Good God, what’s the 
matter with you? You don’t mean that 1 Shallow and vam 
and cruel 1 ” 

Lewis perceived at once the extravagance of his words 
They had been drawn from him by some thought that he 
could not now recognize as his own 
“No,” he said, “I didn’t mean it ” 

“Anyhow it’s not true ” 

“No It’s not even true ” 

In the drawing-room of the Castle he felt that his words, 
and the secret, indefinable impulse that had prompted 
them, made it hard for him to look at Julie There was a 
double guilt upon him — of having betrayed his solitude 
with thoughts of the woman, of having struck and abused 
the child, for the childlike aspect of her was one from 
which he could not escape Certainly he could not escape 
from it now The van Leydens and their friends disre- 
garded her as they would have disregarded a child toler- 
antly admitted to their adult company A knot of them 
was gathered on the hearthrug, another by the stiff 
brocaded window-curtains on the farther side of the room, 
sometimes the edges of these groups broke away and a 
guest with a deliberate air of strolling at his ease would 
pass from hearth to window or window to hearth, jerking 
up his chin and tugging at his waistcoat before launching 
himself into the intervening continent of gilt and beeswax 
Allard van Leyden, while making one of these social 
journeys, checked himself at the great circular table be- 
neath the unjighted candelabra He looked into the mirror 
standing there, frowned, hoisted his chins out of his collar 
and resettled his tie 

“Well,” he said amiably, “been out riding much*” 
“Not much,” Julie answered, and he passed on towards 
the bearskin rug to explain to his sister, who was receiving 
"congratulations on her birthday, why his gift to her had 
been delayed His tail-coat set in a horizontal ruck over his

thighs, there were tufts of black hair and a signet ring on 
the fingers interlaced behind him, there was finality m the 
back he turned on Julie — the finality of a cart-horse with 
its head in a bag and its rump turned outward from its 
stall Those who stood with him were as firmly set — his 
wife, Madame Allard, Goof, solidly handsome, with long 
dark lashes, a moustache trained upward from a straight 
mouth and his father’s high, apple cheeks, Sophie, whose 
sallow forehead and suspicious eyes were almost on a level 
with Allard’s, and three friends whom Lewis had not 
seen before, a youth named van Arkel with curled canary 
hair and a white face that his feminine hands were forever 
touching — an Aguecheek twitching his pedigree, Count 
Sordel, a gruff barrel of a man whose voice and laughter 
seemed to be echoed m the bowels of the earth, and Corne 
Sordel, pretty as a squirrel, highly coloured as a doll, 
but considered unfortunate, Ballater murmured, because, 
though she took no exercise and drank chocolate, only her 
ankles were fat enough to satisfy Dutch requirements of 
ample beauty They were discussing the blockade, for 
Allard’s gift to Sophie had been delayed by it 
“Oh, I do think it a shame!” said Corne “Poor Sophie, 
how disappointing 1 ” 

“It will come in time,” Sophie answered 
“Unless,” Sordel observed, “the fishes have it ” 

“But why Dutch ships should be hindered I don’t 
understand ” 

Goof remarked that it was the fortune of war Allard 
said that he agreed — unquestionably it must be considered 
m that light, but he wished that he could get some English 
playing-cards The groups gathered a little closer to hear 
how, while playing bridge on Tuesday evening, Allard, 
being strong m spades but weak m diamonds, had tried to 

indicate to his partner that 

“But, of course,” said the canary-haired youth, “one 
does need to be accustomed to one’s partner, doesn’t one? 
Like marriage, isn’t' 1 ” 

“You can’t say ‘isn’t’ m English to end an interrogative 
sentence,” Goof remarked 



THE FOUNTAIN 


ii 


“Of course, you can N’est-ce pas ? Ntet zvaar ? Every 
language has it ” 

“Not English,” said Goof 
“Let’s ask Julie,” Corne suggested 
“No, no Leave Julie She has her English boots on 
to-night,” Allard said without moving his back “Goof is 
right Anyhow, Julie knows no more than the rest of us 
about English It’s only a bit better than her Dutch She 
hasn’t really a language at all, though she speaks four of 
them ” 

“Mustn’t it be funny,” said Corne, “not to belong 
anywhere?” 

There was a pause All the horses shifted m the stable, 
considering the humour of the filly excluded from it 
“Napoleon did not belong anywhere,” Goof observed 
“Whenever I think of Napoleon, I always think how sur- 
prised he must have been to find himself married to Mane 
Louise It must have been for him the climax of his career, 
though he’d have been the last man on earth to admit it ” 
The significance of this saying made its way slowly into 
Lewis’s mind The Baroness had drawn him aside to show 
him a case of ancestral miniatures, being particularly 
anxious that he should notice a frame of diamonds m 
which one of them was set, for on the top of the frame was 
a little basket of diamonds and rubies — “not a flower- 
basket as you might suppose,” said she in the explanatory 
tone of an official guide — “not a flower-basket, but a 
guillotine basket She was French, though she looks 
Spanish, and Pieter’s — how do you say it? — Pieter’s great- 
grandfather saved her, and brought her out of France, 
here to Enkendaal And when they were married The 
rubies represent blood, I always think — blood from the 
basket And more than a hundred thousand florins the 
frame is worth ” 

“Napoleon did not belong anywhere,” said Goof’s 
voice, a pronouncement as unexpected as a pistol shot 
While the Baroness had chattered of blood and rubies, 
Lewis had been fascinated by the heavy dreariness of the 
conversation behind him, for he seemed to be overhearing

not the particular dialogue of a particular evening, but the 
words of the years, of the accumulated past, of a thousand 
assemblies m this drawing-room before dinner They knew 
each other so well that they had nothing to say They were 
so carefully trained in politeness that they could not be 
silent, so nurtured m a tradition of affability that they 
could not cease to be affable All night they would con- 
tinue, all night? — all their lives they would continue, had 
continued to tell how, being strong in spades and weak in 
diamonds, they had tried to indicate to a partner, who had 
not been “one of us” that But you need to know your 
partner — like marriage, isn’t? Marriage? Out of the depths 
of Sordel the rumbling recognition of wit inherent m the 
very word Out of Mademoiselle Come a tinkling tribute 
A growl from Allard, and from Goof a brief essay m 
English grammar Van Arkel was a wit, he had but to say 
“marriage”, and every hoof m the stable thudded its 
muffled applause, every hoof but Goofs and Goof perhaps 
was a rival wit — no, not a wit, the van Leydens were 
not frisky, but a dictator on the hearthrug, the explicit 
intelligence of the family, with a shrewd contempt for a 
youth whose feminine fingers were for ever stroking a pale 
cheek The essay m grammar had not a pedantic purpose, 
it was a way of taking the wind out of the sails of wit felt 
to be intrusive and disturbing Into this conversation no 
disturbance might enter It was the conversation not of 
men but of the hearthrug, of the quarter of an hour before 
dinner, of all the quarters of an hour before all the dinners 
that had ever been eaten m the Castle of Enkendaal It 
was not of to-day, it was ancestral, and Goof, having his 
back to the clock, was presiding over it 

“Mustn’t it be funny not to belong anywhere?” 

Lewis said the enamel frame on the extreme right was, 
he thought, a pretty one, and looked over his shoulder to 
see Julie standing where Allard had left her, turning and 
turning the edges of an old copy of the Berliner Tageblatt , 
and he saw her run ahead of him through the Harbury 
meadows and throw herself down m the dapple of a beech 
tree So deeply now was she withdrawn into herself that 

E

she seemed to have no eyes for Goofs group or for the 
little knot that surrounded van Leyden by the window, 
to have neither sight nor knowledge of them and to be 
invisible to them Ballater was leaving van Leyden’s side 
and approaching her She looked up, spoke to him, but her 
movement and speech did not lead her out of the remote 
world m which her spirit was wandering 

“Mustn’t it be funny to belong nowhere?” 

‘Napoleon didn’t belong anywhere,” Goof remarked, 
and while Lewis bent again over the miniatures, he began 
to understand that this saying, which for him had been 
endowed by irrelevance with the insane originality of 
Wonderland, was for the van Leydens a commonplace, it 
seeming to them very natural that the marriage of a 
Buonaparte with a Hapsburg should be the climax 

“Yes,” said Allard, “it must have been a great em- 
barrassment to him ” 

“Not a bit,” Sophie put in, “upstarts don’t notice They 
are so obsessed ” 

“Oh, do you think so?” cried Madame Allard “I think 
they notice all the more ” 

“Well,” said Goof, “I knew a man once — you know 
the kind I mean — I wouldn’t swear he had coloured 
blood, but his mother spent most of her life m Java, 
and — well ” 

“You mean,” Come put m helpfully, “that if you 
clapped your hands, he’d run up a tree?” 

“Precisely,” Goof replied, nodding his head “Well, this 
man ” 

“Dinner is served, Mevrouw ” 

“But the frame with the basket,” said the Baroness, “is 
the gem, the peak of the collection Will you take in Julie, 
Mr Alison? As Allard would say, she is m her English 
boots to-night! He means only that — but there, you under- 
stand What a tragedy, the war 1 What a tragedy 1 Good men 
on both sides It is the privilege of a neutral to say so 
Almost our only privilege I sometimes think ” 

They passed through the antechambers In each a double 
candlestick threw its light on to panels of Utrecht velvet

and the gleaming edge of picture frames Julie’s hand was 
on his arm 

“So we are dining m the tower? I thought ” 

“Always on birthdays,” she said, and afterwards 

“Lewis ” 

“Yes ” 

“Who is going to win this war?” 

“God knows ” 

“But you must feel — you must feel, in your own mind, 
one way or the other Sometimes — listen — sometimes I 
think I want England to win more than anyone m the world 
wants it But for me to want that — oh, if only one could go 
to sleep and wake up when it’s all over Or not wake up ” 
He thought that the man in front had heard her The 
bristles of the neck revolved a little above the collar, the 
head seemed about to turn It did not turn, and Julie’s 
voice, the voice of a frightened child, began with a sharp 
drawing of breath — 

“Lewis If by any chance ” 

He laid his hand on hers Like a pony that, having seen 
ghosts, is steadied by a familiar touch, she trembled and 
was still She was silent while they entered the tower and 
silent while the van Leydens began to drink their soup 
“I wonder,” she said slowly, “what blessed chance 
brought you into Holland of all men on earth?” 



CHAPTER FOUR 


When Lewis opened his eyes next morning and saw the 
leaves of the birch tree outside his bedroom window flutter- 
ing m full sunshine, his mind was filled with a delicious 
strangeness as if, for a reason that he could not remember, 
the world had been transformed since last he awoke to it 
“Reeve, how late is it? Why are we being called so late?” 

“Mr Ballater, sir, he left orders you was both to have 
a lie-m this morning, seeing you was at the Castle last 
night ” 

The sun had long been up, it was the light m the room, 
then, that had made the world seem unfamiliar But it is 
not the light in the room, Lewis thought, that fills me with 
gladness, but a light within me, and as memory ordered 
itself in his awakened mind he remembered his putting his 
hand on Julie’s, her quivering response, her obedient quiet- 
ness The pleasure he had m this recollection was one of 
relief and discovery — of discovery that Julie was not iso- 
lated from him by her gaiety and youth, of relief and 
wonder that m a human contact he had not failed For 
since his father’s death, he had given to the world few in- 
dications that the man of business he seemed to be, the 
discreet elder brother, the careful, regular, accountable 
citizen, was indeed a creature of his will, not the expression 
of his nature, and this schooled reticence of which, as it 
became habitual, he had ceased except on rare occasions 
to be aware, had frozen him so that he could not give of 
himself Now, suddenly, he had given, and to a woman, 
his power to give had been recognized by her, and through- 
out the evemng by a thousand magical communications of

her reliance she had welcomed him into an intimacy with 
herself There had been no luxury of secrets, no spilling 
of confidence, no current of sentiment but that which 
drifted, with a half-mocking glitter upon it, out of their 
association m the past They had spoken, Lewis remem- 
bered, of the Odyssey and she had exclaimed that she had 
forgotten what little Greek she had known “You must 
teach me again,” and he had wondered how the Greek 
characters would look, written m her hand “But my own 
Greek is stale,” he had said “I can read Greek, but I 
can’t read it as a scholar ” She had asked him what work 
he intended to do while he was m Enkendaal “Are you 
going to write a book?” 

“I’m preparing to write one — but the preparation means 
more to me than the book ” 

“Why?” 

“You are like Ballater,” he had answered with a laugh 
“He can’t understand why anyone, who isn’t actually writing 
a book or reading for an exam , should want to be alone as 
Ido ” 

“But why do you want to be alone?” Julie had asked 
“I go for solitary walks by myself and ride by myself, but 
sometimes, I think, I’m almost afraid of being alone ” 
“Perhaps I like it for the same reason that you’re afraid 
of it We want to escape from ourselves — you into company 
and I ” 

“Well?” 

“ And I into a solitude where self is lost Where I 
confront it and see through it ” 

“That’s like you, Lewis, my dear,” she had said with a 
smile “And may no one follow you?” 

“No one can That particular phantom one hunts alone ” 
How she had answered this, he did not know, but he re- 
membered that a look of fear had come into her eyes which 
faded as she spoke of indifferent things and returned when 
she said abruptly, as if she supposed him to be familiar 
with the sequence of her thought “Lewis, I had a letter 
from Rupert to-day From the front He’s hunting your 
phantom, too ” 



122 


THE FOUNTAIN 


u 


A sudden embarrassment had seized their conversation, 
and to put an end to silence he had asked 
“Is your husband a philosopher' 5 ” 

“All Germans are to some extent It's a part of their 
sentiment — or their sentiment’s a part of their philosophy ” 
“Does he write to you from the trenches of philosophic 
ideas — in this letter, I mean 71 ” 

For a moment she had lowered her head, then had faced 
him with shining eyes 

“This letter? I haven’t opened it ” And she had added 
deliberately, as if she wished him to question her “I’ve 
left it m my room m the tower, since tins afternoon when 
it came ” 

“But why?” 

“Because Some day I’ll tell you, Lewis Not now 
I’m happy to-night just talking to you ” 

Again, as the scene drifted through his mind, there was 
a gap m Lewis’s recollection, and soon he and Ballater 
were breakfasting together, Ballater saying “You didn’t 
seem to enjoy the party last night?” 

“What on earth makes you say that?” 

“I thought you were feeling rather out of it You clung 
to Julie as if you were afraid to speak to anyone else And 
the amusing thing was that she let you She’s a minx that 
girl ” Ballater rose from the table and began to fill his pipe 
A good-humoured grin spread over his face and his eyes 
shone “I suppose she thought she’d annoy me and that 
I’d come running to her this morning As a matter of fact 
I had intended to take her out m my car to Goof’s and 
to do some sketching with her But I’ll give her a lesson 
I’ll go to the Huis ten Borgh alone And when she asks 
where I am, don’t you tell her ” 

“D’you know,” he said later as he climbed into his car, 
“I don’t wonder the Baroness married her off young She 
must have been the devil m this place ” 

Lewis smiled “I’m sorry for the Baroness,” he said 
“The ex-governess living m the Castle— she must have 
Lad a fight to keep her end up ” 

“Sorry for heri” Ballater exclaimed, his hands on the

steering wheel “Since she heard about the Wiltshire place, 
she’s behaved like a well-preserved tigress who expected 
me to make love to her but would scratch me if I did 
She’s a snob if ever there was one She’s more van Leyden 
than the van Leydens themselves Look at this marriage 
to Narwitz You can bet your life she engineered it The 
Narwitz family are out of the top drawer even by the 
Leydens’ own reckoning Now she’s mother-in-law to a 
Narwitz — a fine slap m the eye for Sophie — that’s what 
matters to her And the wretched Julie’s married to some 
Boche she never thinks about ” 

“Does she never think of him?” 

“Well,” said Ballater, “I know her pretty well by 
now She’d talk to me about him if she talked to 
anyone ” 

Half the morning had passed when Ballater was gone, 
m less than two hours Reeve would be ringing his little 
handbell to announce another meal, and to avoid the 
interruption Lewis thrust his head through the open 
window of the kitchen and said that he wanted no luncheon 
to-day — he was going to the library at the Castle and would 
not be back until evening 

There was blue sky above the Castle, and, between the 
great tree trunks of the avenue, the wheeling sections of 
the lake held streaks of blue m their grey ripple This 
is how spring comes m England, Lewis thought, when 
spnng has been delayed, at night you go to bed remem- 
bering the winter and in the morning summer is come 
The grass at the foot of the trees was bright and fresh, 
yellow and white flowers had sprung up among it, and 
where the sun fell on the barrel of the tower, the dark 
masonry and the creeper mounting it threw out a radiance 
of gold and green by which the water was enriched — the 
water and, it seemed, the air above the water, for the 
atmosphere of that morning, particularly m its contact 
with the surface of the pools, was charged with a golden 
opalescence, the windows of the Castle shone with it and 
the plumage of birds was washed m its brilliance as they 
passed through the air Soon it will be May 1 Lewis began

to count the April days, and, thinking that the war must 
certainly be decided before the third winter, he imagined 
che tranquillity of his own summer spread out before him 
Even the summer would end He looked at the trees, the 
Castle, the flickering water, seeing them all as parts of a 
vanishing interlude m the reality of his own life, and that 
they might not escape him he halted in the avenue, listen- 
ing to the rustle of an unseen bird m the foliage but hearing 
time drumming in his ears 

Out of this dream he lifted himself and went forward 
In the tower, the sound which was now a part of the rest- 
lessness of the spring day would become the faint whisper 
of a perpetual waterfall, independent of the rhythm of 
time He longed for this sound, and when he had been 
admitted to the Castle and was mounting the staircase of 
the tower, he listened for it, his hand cold on the stair- 
wall, and not heanng it yet, ran forward until he stood 
among the books, and the waterfall came to him like a 
murmur from within the shelves 

Here indeed the hours went by m untroubled calm, there 
being m old books, as m a country churchyard, so deep and 
natural an acceptance of mortality, that to handle them 
and observe their brief passions, their urgent persuasions, 
now dissipated, now silent, is to perceive that the pressure 
of time is itself a vanity, a delusion m the great leisure of 
the spirit As one who lingers among tombs, though at first 
weighed down by the evidences of death, is at last soothed by 
so great a witness to its insignificance and finds wings in his 
heart that shall transcend it, so does he whose rest is among 
ancient writings pass from a despair, m which all endeavour 
seems fatally destined, to a high, winning exaltation In 
these volumes controversy is perished and the politic heats 
are cold, but there come from them certain imperishable 
voices freed of their temporal occasions, even the great love 
songs having transcended the flesh that begot them, and 
the solitary reader, seeing that many arrows aimed against 
time are blunted on its shield while others are made birds 
’of the air and fly out of the archer’s sight above the battle, 
is compelled by the necessity of faith On earth time is

invincible, he says Therefore I will not be at war with it 
but draw my bow at a venture Whither the arrow goes I 
know not, but into an air it goes where there are powers to 
raise and sustain it 

In these thoughts Lewis was quietened He took down 
volume after volume from the shelves They were written 
m many languages, but more of them in English and 
French than in Dutch Here, he perceived, was a library 
of great range, but, above all, an assembly of the seventeenth 
century, and, seeing that many of the books were not old 
but came from the press forty or fifty years ago, he con- 
cluded that Dirk van Leyden had contemplated some vast 
work — a history of seventeenth-century Europe, perhaps — 
and had industriously added to the library that his an- 
cestors had bequeathed to him Yet scarcely of Europe, 
the range, though wide, was not wide enough, too many 
of the books looked upon England He must have had an 
English track of his own, Lewis thought, but there’s no 
telling what it was — the constitution, the Church, the 
Puritan divisions, foreign affairs, domestic manners, 
there’s material here for the study of them all He felt a 
friendly sympathy with Dirk, for this was a period of 
English life that had long fascinated him His imagination 
continued to hover over the seventeenth century, and 
with a volume of Evelyn m his hands he thought When 
Evelyn was a boy of ten there were people who could tell 
him of the Armada m their own childhood — Elizabethans 
through and through, when he was old, Blenheim had been 
fought And he imagined the many others far from White- 
hall, respectable townsmen, small gentlemen m the 
country, who had been engaged in the changing fortunes 
of the period What a story might be written of one of 
them, the pivot, perhaps, of a numerous family, divided 
and redivided against itself by conflicting loyalties At 
one end of the tale would be the conservatism — the very 
odd conservatism — of the surviving Elizabethans, grand- 
parents m the opening scenes, at the other, the children 
of the eighteenth century would be looking back with 
cultivated indifference on the moral heats of the past, and.

m the midst, would be that complex struggle of conscience 
which gave its character to seventeenth-century England 
There were men living to-day who had seen greater and 
swifter changes, but it was not the extent of the change 
m the seventeenth century which attracted Lewis but 
the nature of it — a change from within, he reflected, the 
root of the contest having been in men's minds, not m their 
material conditions Trivial, greedy, vain, ignorant — men 
of the seventeenth century could be all these things, he 
did not shut his eyes to the follies of the period, it was 
not for any supposed romantic perfection that he loved it, 
but for the close contact that it allowed between philo- 
sophy and aifairs, and for its recognition, which began to 
wane with the Restoration, of a certain aristocracy of the 
spirit 

What a story, if one had sympathy and imagination 
enough to tell it 1 Though he did not think of himself as a 
story-teller and the tale would never be written by him, 
the idea of concentrating while in Enkendaal on the 
seventeenth century and using some group of characters 
as a vehicle of research leapt up in his mind and burned 
steadily there He seemed to have come upon the immedi- 
ate task he had been seeking as part of his greater under- 
taking In imagining the life of the past and striving to 
penetrate the minds of particular individuals, he would 
move towards apprehension of the whole period, and, 
while he linked generation with generation and entered 
into their dreams, he would lose himself m the antique 
thought With a pile of books beside him, he sat m one of 
the embrasures so that the window light was easy on his 
page and began to read the Stlex Scmtillam 

Quite spent with thoughts I left my Cell, and lay 
Where a shnll spring tun'd to the early day 
I beg'd here long, and gron’d to know 
Who gave the Clouds so brave a bow, 

Who bent the spheres, and circled m 
Corruption with this glorious Ring, 

What is his name, and how I might 
Descry some part of his great light

I summon’d nature peirc’d through all her store, 

Broke up some seales, which none had touch’d before, 
Her wombe, her bosome, and her head 
Where all her secrets lay a bed 
I rifled quite, and having past 
Through all the Creatures, came at last 
To search my selfe, where I did find 
Traces, and sounds of a strange kind 

Sometimes, when he raised his head that a thought 
might resolve or a cadence declare itself in his mind, he 
heard the waterfall, but soon the external world fell away 
and the genius of Vaughan spread wings between him and 
the passing hours 


His eyes were not upon his book when the larger of the 
two doors to the library — the door by which he himself 
had entered — swung open, and Julie, without knowledge 
of his presence, crossed the room, carrying m her hand a 
volume that she returned to its place Before the shelf she 
stood, her arm raised, her body stretched He spoke her 
name, and, as she heard it, a tremor passed visibly through 
her limbs, and, dropping her arm, she turned, not with the 
wrench of surprise but with the supple alertness of a fawn 
that, hearing an unexpected sound, swings to it and listens 
The world came with her, but not instantly, not fully 
Lewis was looking at her out of a profound detachment 
and, though he recognized her and spoke her name, he 
was still seeing her m isolation from the circumstances of 
her world — seeing not Juhe Narwitz, not the English- 
woman who lived at the Castle and whom he had known as 
a child, not even the girl whose intimacy had been so un- 
expectedly won last night, but a being that seemed to be 
m part the creature of his thought, to have emerged from 
his own imagination — a lovely body caught in the air, eyes 
filled with a wondering inquiry that reflected his own 
wonder, hands clasped on the breast — not this woman, 
not woman even, but speed suspended, movement per- 
petuated m stillness, a grace borrowed from light itself 



128 THE FOUNTAIN n 

The mist of illusion passed from her The world ap- 
peared and she with it But she was not for him as she had 
been, and would not be again 
He asked “Did I frighten you?” 

“No, but I was thinking of you when you spoke, and 
your voice seemed to come out of what I was thinking ” 
“Weren’t you choosing a book? Your finger was crooked 
to pull one down ” 

“Still,” she said, “I was thinking of you I knew you 
had been in the library this morning I supposed you’d 
gone home since then And, when you spoke, I was 
imagining you alone m your cottage, and wondering what 
book you had chosen to read, and thinking that I’d almost 
lost the habit of reading and must teach myself ” 

Her speech, that some powerful emotion was driving 
towards the edge of confession, became breathless and 
ceased, 

“You must have been here five hours,” she said “Have 
you had no food? What have you been working at?” 

He answered that he had been passing from book to 
book, and told how an attempt to recreate m his mind the 
life of the seventeenth century had seemed to him a useful, 
concrete prelude to ” 

“A story?” she cried before he had finished speaking 
What was to be the plot of his story? Who was the heroine 
to be — a Royalist or a Parliamentarian?” 

“My heroine? I hadn’t thought of her ” 

“Oh, but there must be a woman 1 ” Julie exclaimed 
“There’d be no story without her The men would be 
spinning their theories and she’d be pretending to, pre- 
tending, I mean, even to herself, but all the time she’d be 
living her own life and seeing the men as men, apart from 
their theories, seeing mto the men themselves — right 
through the principles that divided them ” 

“A romantic heroine*” Lewis said 
“Romantic* Not m the least They are the romantics 
She’s a realist ” 

She was sitting on the floor, her feet curled under her, 
her supporting hand in a patch of sunlight that lay on the

carpet, and, as they talked, the sun moved to her shoulder, 
her throat, her breast and side, enveloping her save where 
Lewis’s shadow was spread Half serious, half mocking, 
she discussed his supposed story with him, which by now 
had become her story, and though she was so close to him 
and seemed to enjoy his company, he could not but 
observe how remote was her habit of mind from his own 
He saw the seventeenth century from the point of view of 
the English middle-class, his purpose was to see it whole, 
and, correcting his prejudices when he was aware of them, 
to form a balanced judgement of it She, too, would balance 
judgement m her mind, but could not m her heart She 
would admit the Kang’s unreason, Cromwell, of course, 
had right on his side, but still, when intellectually she had 
given Cromwell his due, he remained for her an intruder 
into a drawing-room, a foreign element that had thrust 
itself into the continuing reality of life She spoke of the 
Great Rebellion as if it were a storm that had blown open 
the drawing-room window and wrought havoc before it 
could be shut out again — a natural and inevitable storm, 
perhaps, and one that had had the merit of clearing the air, 
but a storm that m the course of Nature was bound to 
exhaust itself, a rough, exceptional phenomenon Reality 
to her was the social life of privilege Her view was not 
narrow or arrogant, she was trained in sympathy with those 
whose lives lay outside her own, she admired artists, poets, 
philosophers, and said that she often wished that she had 
been brought up to a profession, but when with genuine 
feeling she had discussed Vaughan’s poetry, she asked at 
once whether he was related to the Vaughan who was at 
Agmcourt, and after they had been speaking of Comus she 
wondered on what terms of intimacy Milton had been 
with the Egertons And why not? Lewis asked himself It 
was delightful to try to imagine the performance of the 
Masque at Ludlow, it was reasonable to inquire into the 
conditions of Vaughan’s life and into his heredity 
“But why are you laughing?” Julie said 
“You live m a salon” he answered, “and on the lawns 
outside a great country house Sometimes you drive m

your carriage to visit people and gather knowledge of the 
world, but you never get out and walk Sometimes artists 
and poets and philosophers are among your guests Milton 
has his turn, and you have the same smile — and rather a 
different respect — for the Russian ambassador ” 

She laughed merrily “You mean I’m an incurable 
amateur ” 

“I mean that your world’s different from mine ” 

“I wasn’t so very different when I was a child My 
father was poor and a writer ” 

He shook his head “It’s no good, Julie Your father 
may have been poor, but you lived inside the grounds of 
Harbury House and I lived outside them Shall I confess — 
my mother’s often told me that she wanted your father to 
be my godfather, but she didn’t dare to ask it — or, rather, 
my father wouldn’t let her ” 

“Why on earth not?” 

“Because your father was the grandson of the old 
Marquess and my father knew him as a publisher knows an 
author At least it began so ” 

“But, Lewis, they were friends — old friends ” 
“Afterwards At first they were professional acquaint- 
ances ‘It’s always a mistake,’ my father used to say, ‘to 
presume on a professional connexion We shouldn’t like it 
if the grocer asked me to stand godfather to his son ’ My 
father’s view was the old English one — that a man’s class 
is his own and that he should be proud of it ” 

Julie turned over the leaves of a book that was lying on 
the floor beside her 

“What is more,” she said at last, “I suppose my father 
was only an amateur writer A volume of scholarly essays 
about once in six years ” She sighed and smiled “Oh well, 
I suppose it’s true Perhaps I am an amateur But need we 
remember it so desperately? I could help you,” she added, 
raising her face to Lewis’s, “if you wrote that book There 
are advantages even m being an amateur I know about 
furniture, I know the dress of the period — and china and 
silver I know — or I know roughly and can find out more 
accurately — what flowers there were in England then I

won’t let you stock your garden with the wrong flowers 
Even Mr Ballater admits I know about flowers ” 

She made a smiling grimace and Lewis asked her opinion 
of Ballater 

“He’s funny,” she said, “isn’t he? — like a big graceful 
dog, always bounding up to you with some achievement 
in its mouth and wagging its tail m triumph and expecting 
to be patted Very different from you, Lewis ” Then, with 
abrupt return to the seventeenth century, she added “And 
music — I could tell you about that Above us, at the top 
of the tower, I’ve a little den of my own, next my bedroom 
I have a clavichord there as well as my piano It is very 
old — seventeenth century — a gebunden clavichord My 
husband gave it to me, and I brought it from Germany 
He was a scholar of old music and used to make me play it 
to him, I loved that more than anything Couldn’t 
your heroine be a musician? Why not she and others m 
the family? It’s more probable that, in England about the 
time of the Civil Wars, she’d have been playing the 
virginals, but clavichords weren’t by any means unknown 
And I can play you the music she would have played — 
mostly Tudor music, I expect And later you can hear the 
Restoration changing the whole style, mode having de 
veloped into key Byrd to start with, Lawes for the transi 
tion, then Purcell If she was young at the time of Naseby 
she might easily live on beyond Purcell You must make 
her a musician,” Julie insisted “The old instruments have 
lovely names,” and springing up she set a ladder against 
a bookcase and brought down from a shelf of rarities 
Verschuere Reynvaan’s Musijkaal Kunst- W oordenboek 
m the Amsterdam edition of 1795 

As she spoke of music, her manner grew more tranquil, 
and, instead of breaking from one subject into another 
with swift transitions, she continued m a narrative of her 
delights Lewis, turning Reynvaan’s pages, was well con- 
tent to listen and to think that, while her mind was given 
to what she loved, she became a child again Her expres- 
sion never ceased to be animated, even m sleep, he thought, 
there would be something eager and adventurous m it — 



THE FOUNTAIN

132 

but now her animation was grave and deep, as it had been 
while she listened to the legend of Nausicaa 

“Why do you look at me as if you were seeing a ghost?” 
she startled him by saying, but so absorbed was she in her 
subject that she forgot her question when it had been 
asked and soon she was wondering whether the heroine 
of his book should be better pleased by music when she 
was gay or when she was sad “And yet that isn’t quite 
what I mean,” she added “It’s when I’m excited that I 
need music — even solemn or mournful music My husband 
used to say that if only there were a wine that didn’t cloud 
the mind as well as stimulate it, one should get drunk on 
it and then listen to music I know what he meant I feel 
as he did about it But you are different, Lewis — the other 
kind of human being It divides the world into two groups 
those who take their music drunk and those who take it 
sober ” 

“Those in whom thought is an attnbute of feeling,” he 
said, “and those in whom feeling is an attribute of thought 
I feel because I have imagined, you imagine because you 
have felt Is that your distinction, Julie?” 

“Like a book,” she said, smiling “And which is your 
heroine to be, Lewis? I believe you think that because, as 
you say, I’m an amateur, I’m incapable of feeling or 
imagining anything very deeply, but I can imagine her 
Think of her, beginning life tucked away m the country, 
supposing everything to be secure and settled Imagine a 
girl, brought up to Church and King, who married with- 
out knowing it into the other side — married, I mean, 
some Puritan whose conscience was as genuine as her own 
and who loved her, and loved her more and more until 
she was frightened, for she had married very young, she 
scarcely knew him She respected him but didn’t love him, 
but she thought she’d become accustomed and held on 
And she was beginning to be calmer, less fnghtened when 
suddenly ” Julie was pale, her hand closed over her 
knee, her knuckles tightened “Then, suddenly, the war 
came, and the triumph of his side T hink of how, after 
being separated a long time, they’d meet and look into the

133 

faces of the strangers they had married long ago and half 
forgotten, and how, feeling that their marriage was a dream 
that by some cruel freak had become real, she’d start 
living with him again ” She broke off, and presently said 
m a toneless voice “Then the Restoration And after- 
wards — oh, all their lives to the very last, bitter memories 
and conventional tolerance and stiff concealments for each 
other’s sake And right at the end their children wondering 
why on earth their old-fashioned father and mother still 
couldn’t bear to speak of I could imagine the seven- 
teenth century, Lewis It’s not so far off ” 

There had been so much of her own life m this imagined 
history that her eyes were full of tears “Now you know,” 
she said, when she could not conceal them, “why it’s good 
to have you here ” 

“Because I’m English?” 

Passing him, she stood at the window and looked out 
over the lakes When he had risen and was standing beside 
her, he saw that her hand moved towards him, closed upon 
the air, and was withdrawn 

“I’d have gone to England long ago and found work to 
do there,” she said “Even though he is on the other side, 
I’d have gone But I’m German now They would never 
let me m ” 

“And m Germany?” 

“I’m allowed there, of course But my husband sent me 
out I could only have lived with his family It’s better 
here, I suppose And not only that — he didn’t want me to 
be in Germany It was part of his sentiment that he and 
I weren’t to meet again until, as he said, we had ceased to 
be enemies He asked me which side I wanted to win I 
said I would support his side — I would do what was re- 
quired of me But he repeated his question — he’s the 
honestest man alive — whom did I want to wm ? I told him 
the truth We had been speaking in German, but after he 
had thought for a little while he said m English ‘Then it 
would be an agony for you to remain in Germany You 
might grow to hate me God knows, I might grow to hate 
you ’ ” She continued with difficulty “We spent one more 



! 34 the FOUNTAIN n 

day and one more night together Then, next morning, we 
said good-bye and I came away It was time I was be- 
ginning to hate him Until then I hadn’t I don’t now But 
that morning ” 

“But however the war goes,” Lewis said, “the wounds 
will heal ” 

She looked him m the face “It’s not the war only,” she 
answered 

In the long silence that fell between them, Lewis began 
to see the husband whom she feared, whom she scarcely 
knew, whom she respected but could not love She had 
spoken of him as of one who belonged already to the past, 
but m both their minds he was present now — “a dream,” 
Lewis repeated to himself, “that by some cruel freak will 
become a reality ” But if he should be killed? And meeting 
Julie’s eyes he knew that the thought of death had been 
shared by her, for she was stricken now as she had not 
been by all her memories 

“Lewis,” she said, “will you do something for me? Will 
you let me play to you?” 

“Now?” 

“Yes, now I can’t go down and wander about the 
Castle alone Come up and let me play The walls and 
the doors are so thick that no one will hear or disturb us ” 


With a key that stood m the lock she opened the second 
door of the library — the door of which van Leyden had 
said that it was no longer used — and, passing through with 
Lewis, closed it behind her The staircase on which they 
found themselves was almost dark, but through a sht m 
the wall, itself hidden from them by the interior masonry, 
a weak light entered — enough, when their eyes had become 
accustomed to the gloom, to reveal, m narrow triangles, 
the form of steps spirally ascending The air was dank and 
chill, and the walls sweated Each step, blunted at the edge, 
was scooped downward by the wear of innumerable feet 
“I should have brought a candle Can you see?” Julie 
whispered, with delight in her secret Lewis struck a match 



ch iv THE CASTLE 135 

and saw her face, downward turned and smiling, glow 
above him By a succession of matches they lighted their 
climb until Julie, her fingers wrapped about an iron ring, 
said “This is my room,” and daylight reappeared 
A screen standing across the door had to be moved be- 
fore they could enter the bedroom When they were within, 
it was replaced and the door bolted Lewis saw a room 
that closely resembled the library below, having embrasures 
m the same position and a like fireplace, at the back of 
which — though it was itself used for ordinary fires — the 
vent-pipe from the library stove was visible But the circular 
form of the bedroom was broken An inner segment had 
been cut off by a partition which, though it did not rise to 
the vaulted ceiling, stood two or three feet higher than the 
canopy of the bed In the partition was an open door and 
opposite it another which gave access to the landing 
They went at once into the inner room and Julie shut 
the two doors Here was a second and smaller chimney- 
place, evidently cut in recent years, where unkindled logs 
lay upon a heap of white ashes The room was no more 
than a slice off the circle of the tower, a small bureau, a 
grand piano and a clavichord set upon a low table occupied 
the greater part of its floor-space There was no window 
Daylight came only over the partition from the distant em- 
brasures, and if Julie, when she played, had needed a score, 
it would soon have been necessary to use her lamp But 
the music was m her mind, all that she played was deeply 
familiar to her until, when the Earl of Salisbury’s solemn 
dance was ended, Lewis asked if there were anything of 
Byrd’s that might be said to have, m music, a mystical 
quality corresponding to the poetry of Vaughan Julie 
looked at her fragile clavichord upon which traces of elabo- 
rate painting still lingered The poets, she answered, could 
develop their own instrument The musicians were limited 
by theirs Besides, Byrd died when Vaughan was in his 
cradle “But there’s a little Miserere that might do,” she 

added “Listen ” But her memory faltered, and while 

she was looking for the Miserere , of which, she said, she 
had a manuscript copy, Lewis lighted a sconce on the wall 



136 THE FOUNTAIN n 

above her It seemed to him that he had heard nothing 
more beautiful than this Miserere , whispered by the clavi- 
chord, and seen no change so great in any countenance as 
that which the playing of it wrought m hers, for while she 
played it, and played it again, her lids fell, her mouth 
drooped a little, and her expression, ceasing to be gay and 
restless, took on the composure of an enchantment When 
she had done she was still, her hands upon her lap, then 
at last looked up “Well ? ” she said, and for answer he 
begged that she would play the Miserere a third time, but 
she would not “Some day,” she said, and to rouse herself 
went to her piano She remained in doubt of what to play, 
her fingers expectant Lewis stood beside the chimney, 
watching the shadow hang beneath her wrists like a sleeve. 



CHAPTER FIVE 

During May, Lewis’s view of the activities of the Castle 
was for the most part that of a distant spectator At the 
end of the month there was to be a tennis tournament at 
Rynwyk to which the van Leydens would drive down each 
morning The tennis courts at Enkendaal, laid out near the 
pavilion on the farther side of the pools, were already busy 
with practice, and guests were assembling The cottage, 
too, had its visitor, a submanne officer named Ramsdell, 
who had been interned early in the year A camp-bed had 
been made for him in the upper sitting-room, and m the 
evenings, when Lewis had done his work, they would 
sometimes talk together into the night, but always as yet 
with constraint as if seeking the subject that should release 
them into friendship Their intimacy was slow to ripen, 
and Lewis thought of Ramsdell principally as the tennis 
player who was to be Julie’s partner in the tournament, a 
white figure often to be seen from the tower windows 
When Lewis heard him speak of Julie, the words seemed 
to be spoken of a stranger, so remote was the woman whose 
baffling gaieties provoked Ramsdell’s curiosity from the girl 
whom Lewis knew 

Among the guests at the Castle was De Greve, a yellow 
lath of a man, said to be the best player in Holland It was 
not his custom to play m handicaps, but on the morning 
of the latest day on which entries could be sent in he asked 
Sophie to enter with him Lewis, then on his way to the 
library, was m the little group at the entrance to the Castle 
which heard the invitation given, and observed, as they all 
did, Sophie’s delighted and embarrassed surprise “But

why do you ask me?” she said before her dignity had 
had time to master her astonishment, and when laughter 
greeted her question she became angry and confused She 
did not wish to play, she said then, but her pride telling 
her that to save herself from ridicule she must laugh with 
the others, she compelled herself to laugh, and, with a 
difficult smile at De Greve, consented There was a colour 
m her cheeks that Lewis had never before seen m them 

It was m the spirit of a courteous guest sacrificing 
himself on the altar of politeness — or, perhaps, of pity— 
that De Greve began to tutor her angular competence 
She, m her turn, received him at first as a hired gladiator 
and no more, she would slash balls at him for three hours 
continuously, pausing only to ask how her racquet should 
be held or her feet be placed “Even when he encourages 
her,” Ramsdell said, “she accepts it as if a barber were 
praising her hair or a dressmaker lying to her about her 
pretty figure ” But permitting herself at last to recognize 
that she was indeed a good player and a better pupil, 
suddenly observing that De Greve, m spite of his youth 
and her thirty-five years, had admiration for her game and 
even a smiling friendliness for herself, she let fall one by 
one her defences of bitter reserve “It’s like a bad-tempered, 
suspicious, ugly dog that finds itself being patted,” was 
Ramsdell’s observation, and Lewis himself, m his brief 
encounters with her, saw how her defences were melting 
away A new sap rose m her, an awkward gentleness, at 
once eager and half ashamed, entered her life She could 
not be beautiful, but she could marvellously cease to be 
grotesque, and Lewis imagined how, when the tournament 
was ended and De Greve gone, she would preserve in her 
heart the dry, fragmentary romance of this time and how 
it would flower among the secrets that her pride most 
harshly concealed He felt that he was looking not at 
Sophie as she now was but at the old crabbed woman she 
would become, the woman who would grow into a belief 
that by these few days her existence was explained and 
justified 

But even the change in Sophie engaged his mind no

more than some book picked up now and then and m the 
intervals forgotten The intimacy between her and De 
Greve, together with the entertainments, the mild rivalries, 
the half-stiff and half-lazy good humour of the van Ley- 
dens’ many guests, appeared to him only m fragments 
Passing through the Castle on his way to or from the 
library, he entered for a moment into the life of the place 
but with no feeling that he was a part of it Every day he 
worked without interruption until the seventeenth century 
became for him a mirror m which he saw, deeply reflected, 
the influences of the past, and over which there began to 
move continually — a procession of significant shadows — 
the philosophic and material changes of the next two 
hundred years Outwardly he was at peace, his work pro- 
gressed, his imagination was fertile, he experienced that 
high content of scholars m which the mind is felt to 
be weaving day and night — for m sleep also the process 
seems to continue — a coherent fabric, an emerging pattern, 
to which all thought contributes, nothing during these 
periods of assimilation being wasted or irrelevant And he 
was tempted to imagine that he owed a part of his mind’s 
vigour — the colour and pliancy of the fabric, the fineness 
of the pattern — to the sensation of joy which in those days 
possessed him, an indefinable joy of forward movement, of 
release 

Sometimes m the afternoon, more often a little before 
dusk when she was tired by tennis and he by his work, he 
and Julie went out on to the moors together, or, if the sun 
were still high, into one of the nearer woods, and there she 
lay upon the ground as she had done m the Harbury 
meadows, asking him questions of his work, testing her 
mmd on his and often yielding to him, in a mood between 
smiling and sadness, passages of her deeper confidence, as 
if there were a secret intimacy between him and her, as 
between friends and exiles profoundly known to each 
other m a strange land, which made it natural that thus she 
should speak and he listen Gradually he was enabled to 
bridge the gap between his early and his present knowledge 
of her, until he felt that all his life had, in a mystery,

corresponded with her life, and that now the mystery had 
been illumined, and he found it not impossible, when she 
asked of his own experience, to tell her of Elizabeth— first, 
lightly, of how it was she that had packed his books for 
him, then of her gracious wisdom and loyalty and of her 
parting from him And at last he added “I understand 
now for the first time why I could never love her ” But 
this he had spoken as if to himself, and Julie allowed 
silence to follow it, lying still with an arm of sunlight across 
her and one of her hands dipped in sun 
Their being alone together seldom endured long When 
their time had passed and they began walking back to 
the cottage, Julie would put away the quietness of their 
intimacy, as though preparing herself to re-enter a different 
world She told him then of the thousand little incidents 
that made up the life of the Castle, mocking them in her 
flying narrative and pretending to mock him for his aloof- 
ness from them Again he became for her an elder brother 
whom it was her game to provoke He played to her rale, 
and she, from seeming to torment him, would return in a 
flash to their secret mood, and be his pemtent with laughter 
m her eyes It came into his mind that there was to be 
written the story — he did not know whether it should be a 
comic or a tragic story — of a man who, believing a girl to 
be his sister, had without knowing it loved her all his life, 
and at last discovered that she was not his sister He told 
Julie the story and asked her what its end should be 
Instead of answering, as he had expected, with some 
phrase that blew comedy and tragedy to the winds, she 
was stayed by his question As though suddenly disarmed, 
she began to speak with the impetuosity of a child “Oh, I 

expect it would end with ” and there ceased Her lips 

closed, her cheeks rushed with colour, her eyes surren- 
dered to him in a deep, swift glance the tremor of her 
mind, and when, at the entrance to the cottage, they met 
Ballater, who thrust his arm into hers and said “ Alis on has 
had quite as much of you as he deserves for one day, come 
and see what’s happened in my garden,” she had not her 
customary light, quick answer for him, but released her-

self, saying that it was late, she must go to the Castle and 
dress 

But Ballater was without mercy 
“That’s what comes of going for walks when tennis 
is over ” He waved his hand towards his flower border 
“No time for the important things of life Or the important 
people ” 

“Shall I come and dig m your garden?” she said “Will 
that satisfy you?” 

“For heaven’s sake, no 1 You’re a bit late on it m the 
middle of May Although,” he added, going into the 
house, “to save a celibate scholar from interruption, I’ll 
give you a patch to weed after tennis every day ” 

He kissed his hand to her with a flourish and was gone 
The clumsy banter was ended She stood beside Lewis, 
staring across the valley 
“It is true,” she said 
“What?” 

“That I interrupt you ” 

“No ” 

After a silence, forcing herself to look at him, “But it 
might become true,” she said, and added, “for both of us, 
I mean ” 

Ballater’s flowers were bending their heads to a ground- 
wind and a sharp gust hissed m the foliage overhead A 
cloud moved over the sun, which was near to setting 
“Good night, Lewis,” she said “I’ve been happy to- 
day ” 

When she had been gone a little while, Ramsdell thrust 
his head out of an upper window 
“You’d better come in for your gm and bitters, Alison 
There are some dispatches, too, m the Handelsblad Come 
and translate ’em like a good fellow ” 


Lewis’s work went forward steadily, but beneath the 
calm of his scholarship was the undercurrent of a secret 
and opposed delight Hour by hour he made his way while 
seated at Dirk’s table, but all his being, sleeping or waking,

m labour or idleness, was no longer given to that perfect 
continuity of speculative thought which had been his 
peace Once more, as in the days when the tunnel was 
being dug m the fort, he was aware of an external world 
knocking at the gates of his meditation His power to work 
remained obedient to his will, what was threatened was 
that singleness of spirit which, for a purpose more far- 
reaching than that of his history, he desired above all else 
to cultivate 

When, leaving his books, he went into one of the em- 
brasures of the library and looked down over the lakes 
and the garden, he saw little figures moving below, and 
saw them now, as he had not before, with a consciousness 
of his own separation from them If they were at the base 
of the tower, on their way to the boat-house, he heard 
their voices and sometimes their words, if they were on 
the upper lake, it was the cluck of their rowlocks he heard, 
if they were on the tenms courts, nothing came to him but 
their flickering movement, thrown up by a background of 
trees Formerly they had been in his sight and hearing 
but had penetrated no further than the outermost fringe 
of his thought Now he seemed often to know Julie’s 
presence among them before his eyes had observed it 
and instantly he was m imagination projected into their 
company As he watched, he began to fancy that he was 
invisibly at her side, that her speech was secretly for him, 
that in her far-distant figure he could distinguish, not only 
the body’s supple grace, but the tautening of her limbs 
as she ran, the wind’s quickness m her hair, and, as 
she swung her racquet, the tension of her breasts From 
this external voyage he dragged himself back, in the 
mstant hating her for having summoned him, in the 
same instant filled with joy A recollection of her child- 
hood and of the different love he had then had for her 
quietened his mood, and he began to think of her with 
compassion, not with desire, until at last, the sensual 
imagination overcome, his mind was for a little whale 
emptied of her, and he came back to his work But even 
his work was coloured by her The analogy with her own

life, which both had perceived in her imagining of the 
conflicting loyalties of the seventeenth century, persisted 
in his memory In the passages of history she would appear 
In all the pity, the vanity, the tragic beauty of mortal 
things, she was present, and the past became her con- 
text, from which in her own loveliness she emerged The 
page faded, she only remained, until once more by an 
exercise of will he banished her 
A great part of his work at this time was upon Dirk van 
Leyden’s papers, and every day the Baron visited him to 
ask what progress had been made The old man had been 
inclined at first to guard the papers with a jealous caution 
He would bring the keys, open the boxes and display their 
contents as an exhibit, he would hand a document to 
Lewis and permit him to examine it, but he seemed always 
anxious to have the box shut again and, when he departed, 
did not leave the key behind him This family treasure, 
Lewis had thought, which has been denied to the scholars 
of Leiden, will not after all be shown to me That is too 
much to expect But it had happened one morning that 
the Baron, having heard — perhaps with surprise — that 
Lewis was a horseman and that he and Julie used often 
to ride together m Harbury Park, had invited him to leave 
his work and to ride across the estate with him to visit 
a tenant who had been injured m fighting a fire in the 
pmewoods Lewis had accepted, knowing that he was 
being offered a privilege that it would be ungracious 
to refuse and suspecting that van Leyden had some 
reason for inviting him other than a wish for com- 
panionship During the outward ride they spoke little 
At the door of the tenant’s cottage, while the Baron 
and the injured man were talking like two peasants of the 
local past and of the dead worthies of Enkendaal whom 
they had known or their fathers had told them of, Lewis 
won the heart of the grandson of the house, a lad of eight 
or nine, by admiring the little figures of men and animals 
that he had carved m wood and by himself trying to carve 
a figure of old van Leyden with his gaiters and short coat 
Though the wood was soft and the child could use it with

a rough skill, Lewis’s attempt was a poor one, but the 
attempt was made and the boy, proud of his own work, 
was even better pleased by his rival’s failure than he would 
have been by his success When the two figures were 
finished, van Leyden exclaimed with pretended anger 
that they were libellous, that he could not part with 
either of them, and bought the child’s with a note that he 
took folded from his pocket so that none saw the value of 
it “It is too much,” the grandfather said from his chair, 
knowing well that it would be too much “Then I’ll take 
the donkey as its companion,” answered van Leyden, and, 
while the old tenant was laughing and protesting, he and 
Lewis were on their horses and away “Devil of a job,” he 
said, “to make my people take money even when they’re 
sick and need it for little things ” 

He took the wooden figures out of his pocket as he rode 
and began to chuckle over them “Sophie has been say- 
ing for years that I owe myself a new hat,” he declared, 
and Lewis began to understand that van Leyden tested 
strangers by their contact with his tenants, whom he knew 
and loved By carving this figure, by sitting down to work 
with the boy and dissolving the grandfather’s pride in 
laughter, he had won the Baron as a friend, and their 
homeward nde was a journey at ease Entering the grounds 
of the Castle, they came up with Julie walking alone and 
drew in their horses beside her “Look,” said van Leyden, 
producing the caricatures in wood “You see how much 
respect you English have for your hosts 1 ” From the 
stables, he took Julie and Lewis into the Castle and up to 
the library They knew not why, but he would have it so 
And in the library, seating himself at Dirk’s table, he 
plunged mto the subject which, Lewis now perceived, 
had long been in his mind 

“Tell me,” he said, “you set a pretty high value on 
those papers — such as you’ve seen of them?” 

“They may be very valuable They are of three kinds 
as far as I can judge,” Lewis answered “First, there’s 
a mass of material on the seventeenth century — detailed 
stuff that he seems to have picked up in English country

houses, local, parish history and domestic history of all 
sorts, copies of old letters — how much of it is new material 
I can’t yet tell It may be priceless Then there’s material 
for a history of your own family with his comments — pretty 
harsh and shrewd sometimes And there’s a third group 
The glances I’ve had tell me little of it I think he must 
have had it m his mind to build up, not as a consecutive 
narrative but m thousands of fragments that made some 
pattern for him, a kind of spiritual autobiography There’s 
poetry among it There are essays m which he seems to 
have been arguing with himself There are letters m his 

own hand written to himself and letters to others ” 

“Named people?” said the Baron “I mean people we 
know ” 

“Certainly ” 

“Not posted?” 

“They weren’t intended for the post,” Lewis said, 
“any more than the letters he wrote to Dionysus ” 
“Who?” 

“To Dionysus To half the gods of Olympus for that 
matter The point is that these letters were one of his ways 
of expressing himself I think he must have had an idea 
that ” 

“I’ll tell you what his idea was — one of them anyhow 
The fellow from Leiden told us that, besides, it was com- 
mon knowledge He thought that for him everyone who 
ever lived was still alive He’d say that he was going out 
for a walk with Napoleon — but I think he said it to rile 
people and shock them I don’t think he believed it The 
Leiden fellow said it was an interesting mental case — m 
short, that Dirk was mad That’s why I sent him about 
his business No Leyden has ever been mad ” 

“Did you know,” Lewis said, “that some of the papers 
were m code?” 

“Yes,” the Baron answered “I knew that I’ve had 
people wanting to decode them I wouldn’t allow it It 
was just idle curiosity They said he was mad They didn’t 
attach any value to the papers ” 

He had seemed to be about to say more, but hesitated 



THE FOUNTAIN

146 

“Would you be glad,” Julie said, “if he turned out to be 
a great writer?” 

“Great writer?” van Leyden repeated, as if the idea had 
entered his head for the first time “Oh, I don't know about 
that The point is one doesn't like to shut away what may 
be of some value if there's a chance of its being investigated 
by a man of discretion I don’t want strangers poking 
about at Enkendaal,” he exclaimed, raising his voice and 
blowing into his moustache, “fellows, I mean, who'd treat 
our papers as if they were some exhibit in a public museum 
And I don't want fools coming here m little black coats 
and bowler hats, and bowing and scraping to me because 
I'm van Leyden van Enkendael, and then having the 
damned insolence to tell me that my uncle was mad ” 

He rose and, clasping his hands behind his back, strutted 
to and fro in the great room like a nervous sea-captain 
pacing his quarter-deck with the enemy m sight Julie, 
seated on a high, embroidered stool, her body thrown 
back, her head a little lowered, her hands clasped about a 
raised knee, observed him with amusement and, without 
speech, shared her amusement with Lewis 

“We all know what you're going to say, Oom Piet Why 
not say it? You are going to offer the papers to Lewis on 
condition that ” 

“No,” said van Leyden, coming to a halt “That's where 
you're wrong That's where a woman would be wrong 
nine times out of ten — making conditions Choose your 
man right and conditions can go hang There are the 
keys on your table,” he said to Lewis “You know my 
mind” 

Dirk van Leyden's papers had become a part of Lewis's 
work In the latter days of May he was increasingly glad of 
them, partly because they were the occasion of the Baron's 
visits to the tower Simplicity of manner and a stern pride, 
deep, stubborn prejudice and a fearless originality of spirit, 
continually revealed fresh harmonies and discords in the 
old man's character, and Lewis was never tired of hearing 
his shrewd comments on men and affairs Enkendaal was 
his world, but so profound was his love and knowledge of

it that, for him, all the world was gathered m to Enkendaal 
“A peasant,” Dirk had written, “seems stupid to townsmen 
because, when making a decision, he so often refuses to 
be guided even by reasonable argument addressed to that 
decision But he is not stupid, he is wise He rejects the 
particular argument because it bears too closely on the 
subject to be decided It is new, raw, human, fallible He 
prefers to submit each question, however small, to the 
sum of his experience and tradition — a method that 
townsmen find tedious, but one that may well be God’s 
method of judgement At least, I hope so, for if we have to 
justify ourselves by reason then we shall be lost, but if we 
have the benefit of God’s experience of mankind there is 
a chance of salvation If God is a judge, a statesman, a 
schoolmaster, a priest or a cultivated woman, we shall all 
be shut out, but if he is a peasant, he will know that we are 
fools and give us shelter for the night ” “And that little 
clerk,” the Baron exclaimed when Lewis had read the 
passage to him, “that little black-hat from Leiden, who 
didn’t know a cat from a cow, said that Dirk was mad 1 ” 
As the days passed, van Leyden became more and more 
persuaded that Dirk’s papers would prove to be an asset 
to his family and an asset of a kind to which he attached 
exceptional value “You mustn’t think,” he said to Lewis, 
“that I despise men of letters I had a taste for history 
myself when I was a boy Might have gone further with it 
if I hadn’t had other things to do But scholarship and 
soon has never been much m our line You know,” he 
added, “that it is not now the custom of the old land- 
owning families of Holland to take much part m politics? 
Diplomacy — yes, sometimes The Foreign Office — yes, 
perhaps, now and then But party politics — no And the 
bourgeoisie m the towns say we are effete *We produce the 
statesmen,’ they say 'We produce the writers, the artists, 
the scholars ’ Of course it isn’t true Van der Wijck and 
Pijnacker Hordijk were men of family So is John Loudon, 
who ’s foreign minister to-day But it has an appearance of 
truth I’d dearly love to see a collection of Dirk van 
Leyden’s work correct the balance If it were good enough,

it might go through Europe in translation — eh? What 
d’you think?” 


One day, m a tone of challenge seemingly prompted by 
some vague resentment, Ballater asked “Why don’t you 
bring in Julie to help you with Dirk’s papers? I should ” 
“You would,” Ramsdell interjected 
“Well, why not? She’s a bit of a historian, isn’t she? 
Besides it would give her something to do She needs it ” 
Lewis answered lightly that Julie was playing too much 
tennis to care to be shut up in the tower, but the thought 
that, if he asked her to work with him, she might consent 
had an increasing influence on his imagination, and he 
began to be aware of her absence, to feel that there was m 
the library an emptiness waiting to be filled They met 
less often now, scarcely ever was she unaccompanied, but, 
when they encountered by chance, the presence of others 
sharpened the intimacy of their private communication, 
and, though they might part without having exchanged a 
word, Lewis went on his way feeling that they had been 
alone together And yet, how little I know of her, he said, 
returning to the cottage at the end of a morning’s work 
Many women are like stringed instruments, they respond 
to a touch, and we suppose that they have music m them- 
selves And he forced himself to think that she was what 
she often appeared to be — frivolous, nervous, vam, power- 
ful only m her power of interference Was he not living, or 
attempting to hve, a life that was a perpetual challenge to 
the mterference of the world? Every child that sees water 
lymg still picks up a stick, breaks the surface, throws all 
the reflected images mto confusion, and nothing so cer- 
tainly provokes the curiosity of women as the spectacle of a 
man withdrawing himself from their company In women 
curiosity may take many forms — hatred, contempt, even 
love or the semblance of love But whatever stick they 
choose, some stick they will seize to set calm swirling, for 
their fish are all m troubled waters Calmness of spirit is 
exclusive of their claims, the deadliest enemy of their

nature And perhaps, Lewis added, the enemy of Nature 
herself 

Ramsdell was m the verandah before the cottage and, no 
sooner had his talk of ordinary things broken in upon this 
jangling argument, than Lewis saw it for what it was — a 
bitter generalization and no more A schoolboy trying to 
excuse himself for the failure of a morning's work might 
well be ashamed of it, he thought She was beautiful and 
very young Already her life had knotted itself m a way 
that defeated her hope It was natural enough that she 
should use him, who was once her schoolmaster, as an 
emotional confessor But while Ramsdell was saying that 
Ballater had gone to the Huis ten Borgh and would not be 
back until evening, Lewis could give him but part of his 
attention He found that, as the disturbance of his mind 
was not to be quelled in bitter reproaches, so also it was 
not to be explained away 


“A good morning?” Ramsdell asked, when he and 
Lewis were sitting together at their food 
“Not as good as it should have been ” 

“Why not play tennis this afternoon? You’ve probably 
worked until you're stale ” 

They looked out at a darkening sky and Ramsdell 
shrugged his shoulders “I hope the weather will hold 
Julie and I are supposed to be playing a single at z 30 to 
practise her back-hand ” 

He looked searchmgly across the table, and paused, as 
if he expected that his having spoken of Juke would 
provoke Lewis to speak of her But Lewis was silent and 
soon Ramsdell went on “Sometimes she plays tennis like a 
fiend When she starts slashing, it's useless to steady her 
What’s more, it doesn't pay Sometimes everything goes 
out and it’s hopeless But sometimes everything goes in — 
like a twelve-inch on the target There’s no holding her

began by giving it easy to her forehand when he could

on her mettle and she began to hit Sophie van LeydeD 
was left standing, and even De Greve had to play all out 
She passed him at the net She plugged him in the back- 
hand corner She could do nothing wrong She didn’t 
speak to me for five games and we won them all Then, 
suddenly, after bringing off a drive like the kick of a mule, 
she turned round to me with her eyes glistening and 
smiled one of her pleasantest, laziest smiles ‘Well, that’s 
that 1 ’ she said And so it was She played afterwards like a 
lady and we quietly lost the set There’s ram,” he 
added, looking at a splashed window-pane, “that probably 
puts the lid on tennis for this afternoon It’s cold too I 
suppose you’ll go back to your library?” 

“I expect so Why?” 

“If we’re going to have an afternoon m — what about a 
game of chess?” 

They went into the upper sitting-room when their meal 
was over and took out the chessmen, a great ivory set of 
German origin, given to the Baron by Narwitz and lent by 
Julie to the cottage, a beautiful set deeply carved, cool and 
sharp beneath the fingers The first game was short, for 
Lewis allowed a bishop to become entangled and lost his 
king’s knight in an attempt to protect it “You ought to 
have seen that trap Your mind wasn’t on it,” Ramsdell 
said He began to re-set the pieces for a new game, but 
before the array was complete his eye fell on a newspaper 
paragraph that mentioned the pyramids, and soon he was 
speculating on the mechanics of building m ancient Egypt 
Scrambling to his knees on the floor and spreading out 
paper there, he showed, with diagrams and slide-rule and 
with the poker as model, how unexpectedly small was the 
man-power necessary to raise a great monolith He was one 
of those naval officers who temper a keen professionalism 
with a passion for argument on remote unprofessional sub- 
jects He would sit down to what he called a “cag” as 
eagerly and as patiently as a dog before a rabbit hole, and 
Lewis was fascinated by the variety of his knowledge, the 
product of wide , scattered reading and an abnormal memory 
for detail He was expert in chronometers and m the his-

tory of timepieces of all kinds, he had collected knowledge 
of witchcraft, magic and the reading of omens, and was 
full of an ingenious theory of the mysteries of Eleusis, he 
was a disciple of Mahan and followed the everlasting prob- 
lem of sea-power to the Aegean m the fifth century before 
Christ, showing what effect the periodic north wmd had 
had on the fortunes of Greece and so of the world “If the 
Etesians had blown from the south,” he exclaimed as a 
challenge to argument, “the world might never have been 
civilized ” 

From the naval power of Greece, it was an easy step to 
her philosophy, and Lewis wondered whether the conver- 
sation had from the outset been led towards it, so willing 
was Ramsdell to discuss the opposed ideals of the active 
and the contemplative lives On this subject they fell into 
long and tranquil debate The appearance of the room, the 
patter of ram on the windows, faded from Lewis’s know- 
ledge, and he saw before him nothing but Ramsdell ’s bony 
face and the mingled red and ivory of the pieces on the 
chequered board These seemed to be enclosed m the com- 
pass of his argument They became, not an individual face 
and a group of distinguishable chessmen, but the visible 
focus of his mind 

The qualities that equipped a man for a life of medita- 
tion, Ramsdell was saying, were negative qualities, their 
peacefulness was the peace of death, and Lewis, who was 
debarred by his own unfaith from using the Christian de- 
fence, said that nothing was so vital as thought and nothing 
so enduring “But only if it leads to action,” Ramsdell an- 
swered, “otherwise it is still-born ” It was the orthodox 
attack and invited the general answer that all thought had 
a continuing effect independent of any action that might 
spring from it As there was a physical air that men breathed 
in common, so there was a spiritual air that, m the pro- 
cesses of thought, they drew upon and exhaled Some 
thought purified or enriched it, other thought corrupted it, 
and m this perpetual struggle there were no divisions of 
time or place or language Action perished, thought did 
not

* 5 * 

As from this outline of their opposed theories they pro- 
ceeded to the arguments m support of each, and Lewis 
threaded his way through the evidences for the continuous 
effluence of thought, there came a moment when he asked 
whether Ramsdell had not often found himself m a house 
that welcomed or repelled him, not by its appearance but 
by some influence of the spirit within it Did not the 
thought of vanished occupants linger powerfully m certain 
woods and gardens? “Yes, that is true, 1 ” Ramsdell answered 
slowly “Certainly it is true of ships ” The recollection of 
a personal experience moved m his eyes, and for an instant 
the external world flooded m upon them both Hearing 
Ramsdell say “Certainly it is true of ships,” Lewis heard 
also the ram and the trickle of water from the roof gutter, 
but again, as the discussion went forward, his being was 
gathered up in it Through speech and through silence 
there flowed, like a calm, deep river bearing him away, a 
persuasion that only in a life of contemplation would peace 
come to him, such a peace, exclusive of the senses, as now 
whispered its first secrets in the stillness of this room Out 
of the dusk an ivory knight raised a horse’s head, the eyes 
wide and frozen, the throat dully gleaming, and the array 
of chessmen put off their substance in his mind They 
were as spirits that had attained to a final composure, m 
their world, many battles would be fought of which they 
were the instruments but they would not be partakers m 
battle Listening to the voice arguing against him, he 
watched the beads of light on the horse’s ivory mane, and 
suddenly Ramsdell’s hand came out, plucked the knight 
from the board and twisted it between his fingers m the 
air Soon he set it down m its place The serrated mane 
was flecked with a low, fixed illumination, the eyes were 
again frozen and wide, and there sprang up m Lewis a 
certainty that this hour through which he was passing 
would not vanish, that there was an enduring essence m it, 
that even now its thought was moving out on an unending 
journey “Throw a stone into a pool,” he said “Out go 
the npples, they don’t cease when the stone ceases to move 
And if the death of the body does not check the continuous

153 

movement of thought, do you suppose that the withdrawal 
of the body into a hermit’s cell will check it?” It was the 
meeting-point of many paths of argument that he and 
Ramsdell had searched together — a point from which new 
paths sprang, and now the pressure of circumstance, which 
that morning had been so heavy upon him, seemed to 
have been lifted When Ramsdell questioned him, answers 
leaped to his mmd A certitude beyond reason was the im- 
pulse of all his reasoning He felt once more a pulse of the 
spirit beat in his purposes, and when, in the midst of a 
sentence, Ramsdell broke off to say “That must be Ballater 
coming back,” Lewis heard the step on the gravel below 
as if it were the echo of a life and of a world through 
which he had already passed 

Though the afternoon was becoming old, light within 
had been increasing, for only scattered wisps of the storm 
now remained m the sky, a clearer shadow hung beneath 
the jaws of the knight, the polish on the ivory throat was 
heightened Fine streaks of shade, luminously edged, de- 
clared themselves among the tiles surrounding the fire- 
place, and the newspaper with which the fire had been 
laid shone behind the bars 

Ballater, who was always busy, would have orders to 
give to the servants or letters to write before he came up- 
stairs, they thought, his arrival would not disturb them 
The argument was taken up where it had rested, and 
would have been long continued in peace, but while 
Ramsdell was speaking footsteps were heard on the stair 
They were not Ballater’s Lewis knew whose steps they 
were 

Into the tension of an armed, excluding silence, Julie 
entered 

“May I come in?” she said, and, something m their 
appearance striking doubt or wonder into her, she added 
“You look like conspirators What have you been talking 
about? Secrets?” 

They were standing before her when suddenly she 
dropped on her knees beside the hearth “They must be 
deep secrets that keep you by an unhghted fire on an after-

noon like this May I have some matches? I’ll make tea 
for you ” 

She stretched out her hand for the box and insisted 
upon lighting the fire herself Nor would she allow Rams- 
dell to order their servant to bring up tea “I know you 
have stores of things m that cupboard,” she said “Let’s 
make it ourselves I’m hungry I walked through the ram 
and came in soaked When I was changed I couldn’t face 
tea with mother and Sophie So I came here ” 

After her first swerve of uncertainty m their presence, 
an uncertainty that had set her tongue racing and given 
an abruptness to all her movement, she began to speak 
more steadily, but with an air of feeling her way towards 
their confidence An intuition warned her that the barrier 
she had encountered was one that she could not carry by 
assault, and, as though by some magic she could transform 
herself, she withdrew the challenge of her loveliness and 
became quiet and still Lewis had never before seen her m 
this mood except when she had been alone with him It 
is as if she had lowered a veil over her face, he thought 
When Ramsdell began to chatter to her as he always 
chattered to pretty women, ingeniously seeking for chances 
to amuse and please her, she with a calm grace passed 
through his flatteries and drew him little by little into 
friendliness and ease Soon he and Lewis were back m 
their chairs beside the fireplace She was on the rug be- 
tween them, the yellow dance of early flames upon her, 
talking and listening with so final an abandonment of 
feminine privilege that Ramsdell was tempted to admit 
her to the dialogue that she had interrupted “Shall I tell 
you what our conspiracy was?” he asked 
“Yes,” said Julie 

There was a note m her voice that caused Lewis to 
exclaim “That’s what you’ve been playing for, Julie, 
isn’t it, ever since you came 
“Playing for? For what ? ” 

“The key to the ‘conspiracy,’ the ‘deep secret ’ ” 

“Why do you say that I have been playing for it? I have 
been playing for nothing ”

Her eyes told him that she believed her own denial 
Within her knowledge, she was speaking the truth She 
did not understand why he was angry with her 

“It’s Lewis’s secret as well,” she said, and began without 
resentment, though with wonder and hesitation, to talk 
of other things 

“There’s no secret about it,” Ramsdell broke m “All 
we were talking about was ” 

She sat back on her heels, seeming to listen gravely to 
his attempt to show her the course of the dialogue, but 
though she answered and questioned him with the skill 
of an amateur who knows how to please her company by 
caring for what is of interest to them, she was not listening 
with any depth of attention, and Lewis was reminded ol 
how she had said, of the girl who was to appear m their 
imagined story of the seventeenth century, that she would 
listen to the men talking of their theories but would see 
the men through the theories — a realist, she had added, 
not a romantic Remembering this and observing how 
her hands moved idly from piece to piece on the chess- 
board, he smiled She saw his smile and her own lips 
moved — in mockery, m triumph, m gladness because the 
tension was at last broken? He did not know Ramsdell 
stopped in mid-argument 

“I know,” he said, seeing the change m her expression 
“It must seem odd to you — our sitting up here and talking 
and talking ” 

“You did hate me for coming in, didn’t you? Didn’t 
you, Lewis?” 

“Alison’s an odd creature,” Ramsdell said “Look at 
him He sits there brooding over us like a great eagle 
Part of him’s a plain man of business, part of him’s as wild 
as a martyr who’d go to the stake singing at the top of his 
voice Part of him’s a hermit and part ” 

“Part of him,” Lewis said, “isn’t a hermit No, I 
didn’t hate you for coming in, Julie But all sorts of other 
things came m with you ” 

“Do you know,” she answered, turning her head away 
from them, “I don’t think I’ve ever wished so much that

I was a man as I did a moment after I’d come into this 
room You — you two, I mean — weren’t in arms against 
me personally, I knew that It was because I You see, 
I didn’t want to break m on you But suddenly, when I 
was m the Castle changing, I thought of this evening 
— tea-time, dinner, afterwards — Dutch, Dutch, Dutch — 
and I envied you all up m the cottage Someone to talk to 
Probably sitting up half the night, the three of you, so 
intimate that you don’t have to think of it — a community 
all your own I envied you So I came Nine times out of 
ten it would and even this time, if I’d been a man or 
if I’d been ” 

“If you’d been just a plain woman,” said Ramsdell,“we 
shouldn’t have minded? I wonder if that’s true ” 

“You wouldn’t have noticed You’d have broken off 
for a moment Then you’d have let me sit down and have 
gone on ” While they were talking, the coals had foundered 
m the grate and now, lying on the floor, she began to mend 
the fire with sticks “Can’t you go on now? I’ll say nothing 
if you like Forget that I’m here ” There was a silence 
“Lewis, why don’t you go on?” 


In the evening, Lewis was unable to read calmly, and 
even Ballater’s talkative good humour, when he sought 
it out, was an irritant 

“They were talking about you and Julie at the Huis ten 
Borgh to-day,” Ballater began 

“Who?” 

“Goof and van Arkel That little devil, with his bangle 
and his pre- Charlemagne pedigree and his pale mauve 
tie, is always pecking at gossip There’s no need to listen 
to him ” 

“What did he say?” Lewis asked 

“Oh, he had a phrase He talked about une amitie 
amour euse ” Ballater had evidently given to the adjective 
a more scandalous meaning than it had had m van Arkel’s 
mmd “Of course,” he said, “I know you and I know 
Julie. And I know there’s nothing m it ” 



CH V 


THE CASTLE 


l S7 

Ramsdell stretched out his hand for a French dictionary 
Une amitie amoureuse , he said, was harmless enough to a 
Frenchman, at any rate, it didn't call for the instant pistols 
of husbands But Ballater would not allow that he had 
been wrong “It depends on how it's said," he answered 
“You didn't hear van Arkel say it and you didn’t hear 
Goofs reply ” 

“Which was'*” Ramsdell asked 

“He answered m Dutch, which you wouldn’t under- 
stand,” said Ballater, parrying the attack upon his own 
French “What it came to was he’d never be surprised by 
anything Julie did because she has no roots here ” 

Ramsdell acknowledged that there was something in 
that “You know she came to tea with us this afternoon ^ 
Half the time she was all on edge so were you, Alison ” 

Ballater laughed aloud, and when he had done laughing 
he too turned to Lewis “What, m fact, are you playing 
at?” he asked “You may not have noticed it — you notice 
damned little outside your tower — but Julie has changed 
She still comes painting with me now and then, and there’s 
the devil m her sometimes, but she’s changed — or at least 
I think so ” He had the air of a baffled tactician “She’s 
damned difficult ” 

Lewis held his peace He could not trust himself to 
answer And presently Ballater returned to the subject by 
saying, with the resentful solemnity of a man who had 
never before known himself fail m analysis of women, that 
he had supposed she was worried about her husband 

“Not that she’s m love with him, or ever has been 
Still, when a girl of that age and one with her temperament 
has been married three months and then suddenly 
Anyhow, I thought she might want to talk to me about 
him ” 

“WelP” said Lewis 

“She didn’t We were walking over the moors, 
looking for a place to paint, and for the sake of saying 
something (she didn’t say a word) I stopped on that bit of 
high ground towards the Huis ten Borgh where there’s a 
gap between two woods and I suggested we might paint

there She said ‘Not here/ and no more Then suddenly 
she began to talk and what she talked about was you ” 

“Which gap between two woods'*” Lewis asked 

“To the east You can see Germany from it And 
do you know what she said about you?” Ballater insisted 
“She said after the war, would you go back to your office? 
I told her I thought not, you hadn’t got a family hanging 
round your neck now as you had once, probably, unless 
you got tangled up m some way, you’d do your own queer 
job ‘What do you mean by tangled up?’ she said I had 
been thinking of the fort I told her how one night, when 
you and I were digging m the tunnel together, we’d 
suddenly realised that, though we were trying to get out 
and would get out if the tunnel succeeded, to escape was 
the last thing that either of us wanted ‘Then why did you 
go on?’ she asked I said we had to, we couldn’t stand out 
of it ‘Lewis will always get tangled m something,’ she said 
‘He’s not cruel enough ’ Do you know,” Ballater con- 
tinued after a pause in which Lewis made no reply, “I like 
her even better when she’s serious than when she’s pre- 
tending that nothing matters or ever will When she’s 
serious, she’s always half frightened, and that little white 
patch m the colour of her cheeks becomes whiter and her 
eyes stare at you as if ” 

“And then you want to console her, don’t you, Ballater?” 
Ramsdell asked 

“Well, you know,” Ballater said, “it’s all very well for 
you to laugh, but sometimes she is such a child ” 

“Oh, my God!” Ramsdell exclaimed “We can’t have 
that story from you 1 ” 

“But she is She is,” Ballater repeated “You don’t know 
her as I do Isn’t she a child, Alison?” 

Ramsdell leaned back m his chair “Anything less like a 
child than Julie was when she was in this room a few hours 
ago, I’ve never seen She had us at her mercy — I’ve just 
begun to realize how completely And when she had finally 
subjugated us, she lay down at full length on the floor with 
firelight all over her and urged us to go on discussing the 
contemplative life ” 



CH V 


THE CASTLE 


i59 

Ballater laughed “Well, what do you expect? If you 
shut yourself up and talk philosophy, any woman will play 
hell with you And lying on the floor, if you have a figure 
like hers, isn’t a bad way with philosophers ” 

“I observe,” said Ramsdell, “that you are becoming less 
paternal You have noticed the shape of her ” 

“A few hours ago,” Ramsdell had said She had been 
stretched out m the place where Ballater was now tracing 
patterns on the rug with the stump of a poker, and so 
deeply was the vanished scene impressed on Lewis’s mind 
that, while the others continued to discuss her, she ap- 
peared again before him He heard her say “Why don’t 
you go on, Lewis?” and through his imagining of the 
silence that had followed her words came Ballater’s voice 
saying “The thing to judge a woman by is the back of her 
neck ” The discussion of her had not a greater frankness 
of sensual judgement than commonly entered into discus- 
sions of women at the cottage On Ramsdell’s side, it was 
shrewd and light-hearted, on Ballater’s, a mingling of 
sentiment and forgivable vanities Open, laughing, un- 
ashamed, it yet observed its own restraints If any other 
woman had been its subject, Lewis might have joined m 
it easily enough, but, through his knowledge that resent- 
ment of it was unreasonable, there arose m him a hot 
anger because it was of Julie they were speaking Not what 
they said, but that they spoke of her as they would speak 
of other women, fired and silenced him For him she was 
full of secrets hidden from the world By his knowledge of 
her, now and m the past, by the years’ obscure weaving of 
her life with his own, by his power to perceive m her what 
none other could perceive, she was ringed about and set 
apart 

“The key to almost every woman,” Ramsdell was say- 
ing, “is her peculiar, personal pride Find out what that 
is and you can begin to decode the whole cryptogram 
Men run closer to type Most of us follow more or less a 
set rule of honour, you can find out pretty soon how far a 
man will go, and m what directions, apply a certain know- 
ledge of mm to the conventional rule, and you can guess 



z6o THE FOUNTAIN n 

just where he’ll stop sliding and dig his heels m But each 
woman has her own pride She’ll do things that break the 
convention again and again until you begin to think there’s 
damned little she wouldn’t do with persuasion Then, 
suddenly, where you least expect it, she stands like a rock 
It may be some consideration for her children, it may be 
some unspoken pledge to the poor devil of a husband 
everyone supposed she was ready enough to deceive, very 
often it is some pride of money that no man can grasp The 
point is that men have a more or less conventional idea of 
whatmtegnty means But a woman’s integrity is as personal 
to her as her own face It may include chastity or it may 
not, it may include the keeping of one promise but not the 
keeping of another, it may lead her into what seem to out- 
siders incredible contradictions But there it is — it’s her 
own, within its own limits sacred ground She’ll die de- 
fending it If you can tell me what Julie’s root pride 
is, what is her own view of her own integrity, I can tell 
you the rest, I can make a fair guess at what she’d do m 
any given circumstances It’s like a secret ribbon Find 
it and pull it, the whole dress falls off You have her 
naked 

“I can see her lying there now,” Ramsdell went on, 
moving his hand m the air as if she were indeed present 
beneath the shadow of his hand “Nine women out of ten 
would have thought her in some obscure way immodest 
because she stretched herself out between us with her 
frock taut over her shoulders and a great flowing line from 
hip to knee They’d have thought her immodest because 
what she did would have seemed to them a deliberate 
provocation — so open that it gave away the whole secret 
game of allurement It would have been an overstepping 
of the limits of their pnde But they’d have been w r rong It 
wasn’t in any way connected with Julie’s pride I don’t 
mean that she didn’t know our eyes were on her, she did, 
at any rate it can’t have been long before she realized it, 
and she made no attempt to move But she hadn’t aban- 
doned any fragment of her integrity ” 

“How do you know ? ” said Ballater 



ch v THE CASTLE 161 

“Because if she had, we should have despised her It’s 
the infallible test ” 

Ballater stroked his chm and his smile extended “I 
wish I’d been here There was a girl at Goof’s with eyes 
you could sink a ship m — but she was too short and thick 
from waist to knee Of all Julie’s points that’s the best — 
she has flanks like a racehorse When we’ve been painting 
together, picnicking, I’ve seen her stretched out, propped 
on her elbows, eating sandwiches Probably she’s not 
solid enough for the German taste ” 

From wild generalization to close, particular comment 
the discussion moved In mind and body they searched 
her, sometimes with cruelty, sometimes with tenderness, 
often with masculine detachment that was neither tender 
nor cruel They searched her with their observation, their 
surmise, their imaginings, as though she were one of a 
dozen women about whom they might ingeniously specu- 
late and so pass an evening away They are searching 
her, Lewis thought, as though she were not here to listen 
to them, but, while they spoke, he saw her always before 
him The ivory chessmen, still ungathered on their board, 
were moved by her fingers The firelight existed m the 
shadows of her body When Ramsdell and Ballater were 
silent, almost he heard her speak But she is not here, he 
said within him She is lying asleep on her bed m the 
tower, or awake hearing the waterfall It is my own thought 
that has summoned her here, not this argument of Rams- 
dell’s It is my own thought that has enabled Ballater to 
see her lying before us But he could escape neither from 
his anger against Ramsdell and Ballater nor from the 
charged delight of contemplating her with the eye of his 
thought In a determination to escape, he sprang from his 
chair and moved across the room towards the door Some- 
thing m the abruptness of his movement — or perhaps the 
tension of his guarded silence — must have warned Rams- 
dell His words ceased, his eyes came up m inquiry, 
Ballater’s followed 

“Perhaps we’ve had enough of this discussion for one 
evening,” Ramsdell said 



1 62 


THE FOUNTAIN 


11 


Ballater was slower to understand Then, as he read 
Lewis’s face, his expression changed and he became 
clumsily eager to make amends “I hadn’t the least 
idea ” he began again 

Ramsdell broke in upon him “It’s odd,” he said 
“These arguments They go on, you almost forget that it’s 
one particular girl you’re discussing 
Lewis sat down again “It’s my fault, not yours,” he 
said “If I hadn’t been thinking of her and filling the room 
with her, you’d probably not have begun Anyhow, 
now you know what I aidn’t know myself half an hour 
ago ” 



CHAPTER SIX 

Two empty chairs, from which Allard van Leyden and 
his wife had risen, separated Lewis from Julie He could 
see Allard moving down the central pathway between the 
courts, nodding to those who were seated there on scarlet 
benches or in small wicker armchairs Allard's greetings 
were simple — friendly wavings of his slow hand, almost 
English, as they were intended to be, but his wife, feeling 
perhaps m some deep recess of her pride that everyone at 
the Rynwyh tennis tournament was thinking of her as the 
future mistress of Enkendaal, was affable with a certain 
regal condescension When she bowed, her head seemed 
to slide forward over her short neck, like the head of some 
matronly, imperial hen, and the movement accentuated 
the stiffness of her body — a comely but unprovocative 
body encased m silk poplin of the van Leyden length Her 
parasol moved before her, erect like a sword of state She 
seemed to be opening a parliament or visiting a slum And 
how admirably she did it — for , like a queen, she was not 
pleasing herself 

“We must go down and watch Goof and Rallater, ,> 
Allard had said 

“Why? They're sure to be beaten It's comfortable here 
Besides, we get a better view of De Greve ” 

She had not wished to leave the shady terrace at the end 
of the ground The seats there were protected by a little 
group of planes, they were, too, the Enkendaal seats — 
her own But it was her rule not to contradict her husband 
in public, and she had acquiesced, with no more protest 
than a sharp click of her parasol as she put it up Her eye

had fallen on Julie Why should that girl stay on the terrace, 
coolly at ease, while she herself went out into the glare of 
bnckdust and scarlet paint to watch Goof beaten? 

“You will come with us, Julie>” It had scarcely been an 
interrogation 

“Oh, leave her,” Allard had said “There’s no need for 
her to come” — a comment kindly intended, but exclusive 
“You don’t want to, do you, Julie?” 

She had shaken her head Allard and his wife had begun 
their progress alone Their empty chairs divided Lewis 
from Julie’s silence She continued to gaze at the court 
nearest to the terrace — De Greve’s court, and to patter the 
strings of her racquet on the toe of her shoe The fingers 
of the hand lying in her lap were driven into a crumpled 
envelope Seeing it and the expression of her face, Lewis 
understood suddenly that she had shaken her head, not 
answering Allard m words, because something contained 
m that envelope had caused her to distrust the steadiness 
of her voice His lips, which had been about to speak, 
closed again, for the tension m her was strange to him, 
and he looked away across the courts at the diminishing 
perspective of white lines, at the players and their short, 
clinging shadows, at the shifting, speckled colour of the 
onlookers, moving to and fro against a background of 
heavy trees and blue sky and the thm, distant spires of 
Rynwyk This, and all that was akin to it, the historians of 
the war would forget — this lazy prettiness of a continuing 
civilization, this insulated comedy of another world, m 
whose illusion the actors themselves were enwrapped And 
I shall forget it, Lewis said — even the dulled twang of the 
racquet on the toe of her shoe, and the knowledge that, if 
I turned my head, I should see, with uncomprehending 
shame, even with joy m their beauty, the controlled 
struggle of her clenched hand, the rigidity of her shoulders, 
her terrible stillness, her dry eyes If she would cryt he 
thought, and the imagination of her tears — a yielding, a 
confession of herself — flowed through his mind until he 
began to think that, if he and she were m England, he 
could comfort her, though he knew not how If they were 



ch vi THE CASTLE 165 

in England, the leisure he now had, the blissful leisure of 
escape from the world, would not be his, but such leisure 
as was granted to him would be free of the taint of exile, 
and she, too, would be m her own place, which had 
nourished her childhood She would discover, even m the 
midst of personal unhappiness, that reconciliation of the 
soul with its environment, that unspeakable sympathy of 
earth and sky which, m a man’s native country and there 
only, accompany his joy and grief, informing the one with 
light, quickening the darkness of the other, so that his in- 
heritance seems to rejoice and weep with him, and he, 
though stricken, is neither lotless nor forsaken 
A figure, towards which Lewis did not look, had come 
up from behind Julie and seated itself on her farther side, 
asking her permission with a slim bow 
“ 1st es erlaubt diesen Platz einzunehmen ?” 

“Of course, Alex ” She answered m German, since it 
was van ArkePs affectation to speak it The movement of 
her racquet ceased and when van ArkePs thm voice said 
that they were thinking of giving a theatrical entertainment 
at the Rynwyk theatre during the autumn m aid of some 
charity and asked whether she would perform, she an- 
swered 

“That’s a long way off, the autumn,” and added, 
“What charity?” 

“Oh, any charity It will have to be neutral, of course ” 
“You think people would come? Are you going to have 
professionals? If Uncle Pieter entertained them at Enken- 
daal, they’d cost nothing ” 

“They’d want to play all the leading parts ” 

“So much the better ” 

Van Arkel hesitated “Oh, do you think so?” he said 
unwillingly, seeing honour depart from him Then he hit 
on an unanswerable argument “But we couldn’t act with 
professionals, could we? In Holland they haven’t the same 
the same social status as Not that that would make 
any difference to you or me, but there are people who 
and m an affair of this kind ” 

Whether m the end Julie consented or refused to take

part in van Arkel's theatricals Lewis did not know He was 
listening, not to their words, but to the hiss of good 
German well spoken, and, when their meaning came to 
him again, it was not of acting that van Arkel was speaking 
but of the war Soon, he said softly, it would be ended, he 
was sure The folly of it couldn't go on The German army 
(and Lewis imagined his smile of ingratiation) was a pro- 
fessional army, magnificently commanded — but magnifi- 
cently 1 And the English fleet of which so much had been 
expected, what could it do? 

“You think the Allies will be beaten, then?” Julie said 

“Not beaten Not precisely that but I think they 
will make peace Perhaps separately ” 

“They are sworn not to,” Julie replied She had been 
speaking, had been forcing herself to speak, out of a deep 
preoccupation into which she fell back when van Arkel 
was silent 

“You have good news of your husband, I hope?” he 
said politely, as a man might say, “I hope you had good 
weather for your holiday,” and Lewis, hearing Julie catch 
her breath like a sleeper m the shock and crisis of a dream, 
turned It was m his heart to cry out “Go away 1 For God's 
sake go away* Don’t you see how you are tormenting her?” 
but he was silenced by the discovery that van Arkel knew 
well enough what he was doing The blue eyes were open 
wide, the pale lips parted and curled, the whole face, 
ordinarily without life, was quickened and pointed by 
curiosity Every word of his had been a deliberate flick of a 
whip, and now, the envelope she had been holding having 
fallen to the ground, he darted for it But it was within 
reach of Lewis’s hand, the angular German wntmg and 
the marks of its origin evident upon it She took it from 
him with fingers that for an instant touched his own, 
folded it and thrust it into a little bag that was in her 
chair 

“Yes,” she answered, “Quite good news, thank you ” 

“De Grave leads 5 — 1 in the second set!” came from the 
umpire in the court below 

* De Greve is winning his single easily,” Lewis said, but

his attempt to cause a diversion was unavailing, for now 
Sophie and the Baroness appeared 
“Was your letter from Rupert earlier or later than mine, 
Juliet” her mother asked “Mine was the twenty-first ” 
“Mine was written one day later ” 

“Does he say anything of coming here?” 

“He always says he wishes he could come I don’t think 

this letter really amounts to more than that except ” 

“Except?” 

“Well, I think he was excited when he wrote it ” 

“Do you know where he is?” Sophie asked 
“Of course not ” Julie’s lips moved before she added 
“On the English front, I think ” 

“Well,” said the Baroness m the tone of a hostess who 
announces a welcome addition to a party she is contem- 
plating, “I believe Rupert means to come as soon as he can 
get leave ” 

“But will that be possible?” van Arkel inquired “A 
German officer to come to Holland and return?” 

“As a civilian, of course ” 

“Even so ” 

“I think,” said the Baroness, “most things are possible 
to Rupert He has great influence The only difficulty that 
I foresee is that he may feel it his duty to stay at his post 
Once he had a quixotic idea that he and Julie ought not to 
meet until it was all over Wasn’t that sweet of him? 
Queer Sweet, too But now the war has lasted so 
long, so very long ” She sighed, and smiled a knowing 
smile over young lovers parted “What do you think, 
Julie?” 

“I think he’ll stay at the front ” 

“If you asked him ” her mother began 

“I’ll not ask him — never, never ” 

The note of passion m her voice made it inevitable that 
van Arkel should intervene If her control was near to 
breaking, he must, m his shrill, innocent voice of a school- 
girl, ask 
“But why?” 

“Because he would never forgive me,” she answered,

speaking now in her own tongue “Because I’m English 
And, to his honour, he’s a fanatic ” 

She weakened when she had spoken and leaned back m 
her chair 

Sophie tossed her racquet from one hand to another 
“There,” she said, “De Greve has won his single ” And 
then, as if the idea had m that moment lightly brushed her 
mind “But if there’s nothing more than usual m the 
notion of his coming here, why the ‘excitement,’ Juhe ? 
You said he wrote as if he were excited ” 

“I think he was going into battle,” Julie said, and re- 
peated in a fierce agony of constraint “I think he’ll stay at 
the front ” 

“You mean ” van Arkel began 

“Does it matter to you what I mean? You are Dutch* 
You are grey and safe and neutral* You have nothing — 
nothing on either side ” 

“We are all Dutch,” said her mother “Is that some- 
thing to be ashamed of, dear?” 

“No ” 

“Then I don’t think, my darling, you should have 
spoken as you did ” 

“You don’t understand,” Julie said, “how all this has 
been led up to Alex and Sophie meant to make me speak 
as I did Alex has been planning an English surrender for 
hours He thinks that if the Germans come into Holland 
he would become a German Junker instead of a Dutch 

nonentity And Sophie ” 

“Julie, Julie, you are behaving like a child ” 

“And you are angry with me, mother, because I said 1 
am English ” 

“It was not a wise thing to say, dear,” the Baroness 
answered soothingly “It wasn’t even a true thing ” 

“No, it wasn’t even true ” 

“Well,” said the Baron, coming up with Ballater at his 
side “What are you all doing here, fiddling while Rome 
burns? The family’s been overthrown ” 

“We took it to five-all in the final set,” Ballater ex- 
claimed 



ch vi THE CASTLE 169 

“And if I hadn’t missed that shot at the net ” said 

Goof 

While they were talking, Julie rose and moved away She 
stood alone at the head of the flight of steps leading down 
to the courts Lewis could not deliberately join her to 
thrust blunt consolations into her secret mood For a 
moment he imagined himself going up to her and saying — 
there was nothing now that he might say without blunder- 
ing, she was entitled to her silences But presently, having 
already passed her on the steps, he looked up and said 
“Come and watch the tennis, Julie You can’t stand there 
m the sun ” 

“I think I’ll go back,” she answered 

“To the Castle? But you and Ramsdell have a match to 
play this afternoon And, when you’ve won it, a final to- 
morrow ” 

“When we’ve won it f We shan’t beat Sophie and De 
Greve ” 

Lewis had climbed over the parapet of the steps and 
was standing beside her “You don’t want to win?” 

“On the court, I suppose I do I suppose I shall want to 
beat Sophie, anyhow ” She smiled for the first time “But 
I can’t sit here any more, Lewis This is the third day 
People are always coming up and hovering Then they sit 
down beside me I know beforehand what they’re going 
to say What a pretty ground with the trees round it and 
the Rynwyk spires looking over the trees 1 Then what 
a successful tournament — in spite of the war! Then what 
news have I had of my husband? Then — but you’ve heard 
it all Do you know why they do it? Alex and Sophie have 
special reasons, some of the others, too But the rest — 
they just want to know whether I shall be glad or sorry 
when They think England’s losing Have you grasped 
that? Even the steadiest of them Uncle Pieter doesn’t say 
so He goes on saying that, m the end, Germany will 
break But he doesn’t believe it as he did Dozens of others, 
who haven’t the van Leydens’ character, are waiting to 
applaud It’s a sort of play to them They’re beginning to 
tell their neighbours what the end’s going to be, and how

they've known it all along They want to know how I'm 
taking it " And, seeing Ramsdell beside her, she said, “Is 
it true what they all think— that England’s beaten?" 

“There’s the fleet," Ramsdell said with a smile 

“And that’s enough?" 

“Quite enough " 

“So simple?" 

“So simple " 

“Is that conviction or just blind faith?" 

“Oh," he answered, a little embarrassed by her earnest- 
ness “It's just what one feels and knows " 

“You're very English, aren’t you?" 

“Thank God»" 

She laughed and broke m her laughter “Yes, thank 
God," she said 

Julie did not return to the Castle, for they might be 
called upon to play their match, Ramsdell said, before 
tea-time, and he added privately to Lewis that the game 
was already lost with Julie xn her present mood “What 
on earth you’re waiting for," he said, “I don’t know " 

But Lewis waited, sometimes joining a group of specta- 
tors and yielding himself to the drift of their talk, some- 
times encountering Julie as he moved from one court to 
another — a Julie seemingly transformed, the delight and 
provocation of whatever company she was m If he went 
back to Enkendaal, the library would, he knew, be full of 
unrest, and he began to feel that the disturbance m him 
was so profound that it might be long before he could 
work peacefully m the library again All his purposes were 
entangled, his spirit was set on edge, even his will was 
fading him The restlessness of the tennis-ground taunted 
the failure of tranquillity m himself, and when Ballater 
said “Let's go out into the town for a bit I'm bored with 
this place,” he went gladly But as they approached the 
gates he swung round as though a hand on his shoulder 
had compelled him, and looked back towards the head of 
the steps It was long since Julie had been standing there, 
he had met her in other parts of the ground, but he could 
not cease to look for her where she had last spoken to lum, 



CH VI 


THE CASTLE 171 

and suddenly, m this barren, glistening place, he found 
that, though he could not discover her with his eyes, she 
was m the air he breathed, so close that she pressed upon 
his thought, so ardent and pervading that there was terror, 
the dream-terror of a slipping personality, at the core of 
his delight “You’re very English, aren’t you>” she had 
said to Ramsdell, and he heard again the word “English” 
spoken in her voice with a lilt of frivolity in it as a gloss 
upon emotion, heard it near to him, nearer than hearing, a 
sound within him He saw the movement of her eyelashes 
on her cheek as she looked downward, the texture of her 
cheek itself, the hard, sudden gravity of her lips The 
breeze that moved over him was enchanted by contacts 
with her, he trembled under it as if, by a miracle of com- 
munication, its touch were hers 
“I wish Goof and I hadn’t lost that match,” Ballater 
said, and their feet were soon crunching in step over the 
gravel As they passed the railed municipal garden, where 
flowers blazed in geometrical patterns and an old man was 
dusting his boots with a tuft of grass, Ballater spoke again 
“The trouble about a Dutchman,” he said, “is that he 
makes his gardens with a T-square and a pair of com- 
passes ” And while they sat at a cafe their talk passed from 
Dutch gardens to English “Nobody will be spending 
much on their gardens this year,” Ballater said “It will 
be the devil to get them into condition again after the war 
They may never be the same again ” A steeple near at 
hand poured its music upon them while they talked At 
each quarter the sounds of the street were deadened by 
its chime, and Lewis, raising his eyes to the steeple, 
watched the birds take flight from it and return, a little 
flock of birds drifting m from the startled, vibrant air At 
each ringing of the chime, they flew off m the same panic 
of flight, m each silence they returned “You’d think 
they’d learn,” Ballater said, “and either stay where they 
are or stay away Queer things birds Probably they’re 
not just frightened The sound may hurt their ears ” 

At last, having set his wrist-watch by the great clock 
overhead, he declared that, if they were not to miss Rama-

delPs game, they must go back “The glare won’t be so 
bad now,” he said, as they passed through the beflagged 
entrance, and on the steps leading down to the courts he 
added “I like it, bnckdust and scarlet benches and all, 
at this time of day Just when the light’s changing but 
hasn’t begun to fail Particularly looking west Our lawn 
m Wiltshire looks west over the valley on to the opposite 
range There’s a white patch m one of the hills, a great 
gash of chalk, and when you’re having a latish tea the glare 
goes out of the white, it seems grey for a bit, and then 
gradually it comes up again as if there were a light inside 
it That’s why painting in England — Alison, what’s that — 
news?” 

He pointed to a little knot of people ahead of them, 
gathered behind one of the painted seats In the centre 
of the group van Arkel held a paper in his hand, but soon 
he was hidden by newcomers The players on the nearest 
court had broken off their game, the umpire had turned 
m his high seat 

“It can’t be news,” Ballater said “It wasn’t a newspaper 
he had ” 

“A separate bulletin,” Lewis answered “It’s news all 
right ” And Ballater, gripping him suddenly by the arm, 
cried “My God, if it’s peace we might be home m three 
days Odd that we should have been thinking of it ” He 
was about to run forward when Lewis checked him Some 
intuition, some shock of foreboding communicated to 
him by the swirl of that little crowd, made Lewis say “I 
don’t think it’s peace ” 

Ballater looked into his face “If it’s bad we’d better go 
slow — or let the Dutch bang it to us ” Then, his eyes 
lightening again “But why should it be bad? How do you 
know?” 

He went forward and Lewis with him Van Arkel’s 
reading was done The crowd was breaking up Whoever 
turned and saw the Englishmen, twisted suddenly, looked 
away, pretended not to have seen Lewis reading their 
faces — a sneer in some, a wondering compassion m others, 
m all the embarrassment of unspeakable disaster — drew

Ballater aside “Better wait,” he said “We shall know 
soon enough ” 

And as if m answer to him, Julie’s voice from a couple 
of yards away was saying 

“I don’t believe it It’s no good telling me again, Sophie, 
I don’t believe it Where ts the lie?” 

She was facing him, her back to the tennis Supported 
by the railing, she stood on the piece of board that rimmed 
the court, and was raised above those who surrounded 
her Van Arkel, a few feet beyond, had hastily thrust the 
bulletin into his pocket and was uplifting both his white 
hands to applaud a stroke in the renewed game 

“Mooie slag!” he cried, dancing on. his toes “Good 
shot, Mimi 1 ” 

“It’s the Wolff Bureau,” Julie said “It’s bound to be 
a lie ” 

But it was written m her face that she believed it There 
was belief m the steely lightness of her tone, in the bracing 
of her body as though she had been struck What Sophie 
and the Baroness were saying to her, Lewis could not hear 
Their faces were turned from him, their words were lost 
m the muttenngs, the questions, the exclamations of the 
crowd But van Arkel’s voice, high-pitched, excited, 
triumphant, was not to be mistaken 

“Why should it be a lie?” 

“It’s the Wolff Bureau ” 

“Do you accept nothing from German sources?” 

Julie turned upon him with so terrible a mingling of 
scorn and anguish that, though he had not perhaps in- 
tended the full bitterness that had sprung from his words, 
he fell back from her But she did not speak 

“I’m sure it will greatly shorten this terrible war,” the 
Baroness was saying m a fluttering, conciliatory voice, and 
she put out her hand towards Juke as if she hoped to draw 
her away 

“It will It will,” van Arkel cried “With the English 
fleet beaten, the war will be over m less than a week ” 

“What a happy ending,” Sophie put m “Think, m less 
than a week you may be m Germany again ” 



i 74 THE FOUNTAIN n 

Julie was shaking her head She was smiling and lifting 
her head 

“Even if it were true” she answered, “it wouldn’t end 
the war ” 

“Even if it were true! What is the use of saying that? 
The British communique confirms it,” van Arkel said, put- 
ting his hand to the paper m his pocket and patting it 
“Do you think the British Admiralty would paint things 
blacker than they are?” 

Whereupon Lewis broke in “Will you tell me what 
this news is? I’ve heard nothing,” and Julie, looking beyond 
the circle that enclosed her, saw him Her eyes pleaded 
with him for an impossible revocation of the truth Then 
she added, holding out her hand to van Arkel “Let me 
see the bulletin ” 

A rule of honour, that had not forbidden him to triumph 
over Julie, caused van Arkel to hesitate before Lewis’s 
question He touched the paper, took his hand from it, felt 
for it again, and at last with a dry movement of his lips 
said 

“I’ve read it once I’d rather not read it again ” 

“Give it to me, then,” Julie said 

He yielded it to her When she held it folded m her 
hand, she saw Ramsdell beside her mother 

“This is for you,” she said 

Ramsdell knew nothing of what had passed Opemng 
the paper, he began to read aloud the British communique 
on Jutland, which laid so exclusive an emphasis on Jellicoe’s 
losses that it gave to all who heard it an impression of 
overwhelming British defeat He faltered an instant as his 
understanding of it increased, then, m a hardened voice, 
read to the end 

When he had finished reading, he folded the bulletin 
and handed it back to van Arkel “Thanks,” he said Then, 
turning to Juke who had begun to speak to him, he cut her 
short 

“Come on Our game’s been called I came to tell you ” 
She did not move, seeming scarcely to have understood 
him He thrust her through the crowd, almost with

brutality “Come on,” he repeated “For God’s sake, 
Julie'” 

“We’re to play?” Lewis heard her ask 
“What else?” 

She looked into Ramsdell’s face, her eyes shining “Just 
like that?” 

“Just like that ” 

“Very well,” she said 


Lewis stood with Ballater behind one of the scarlet 
benches, watching Julie and Ramsdell play their match 
The Baroness was on the bench, through the mesh of her 
straw hat he could see her pearls and her fingers playing 
with them, shadowy fingers like the fingers of one’s own 
hand seen through water This hot weather always made 
her think of ice, she said The skating at Enkendaal 
“You must manage to come up for the skating this year,” 
she protested There was nothing that could charm him 
more, the thm man at her side answered, “but m the 
winter I shall be in Hamburg, I expect This news makes 
it certain ” 

“You mean peace ” 

“Well, but surely They can’t keep it up now But how 
your daughter is playing* Look at that* You missed it?” 
Ballater’s toe was making patterns m the gravel 
“I don’t believe that bulletin’s complete,” he said 
“Yes, I’m afraid I did miss it,” the Baroness was saymg 
“When one has been watching tennis all day To and 

fro To and fro Tiring to watch, but tell me now ” 

Ballater turned his back on the game “I can’t stay here 
Why not go out and get more news? I believe the thing’s a 
fake, Alison Some land of fake If Jellicoe had been de- 
feated, the Admiralty wouldn’t advertise the losses m that 
way ” 

“Ah — a-ha — d’you see?” cried the thm man “De Greve 
didn’t know much about that This is a game to watch*” 
He leaned forward Ballater swung round to the court 
again But the game was interrupted De Greve was

flourishing his racquet m the air and crying, with the 
angry authority of a champion, the spleen of zpnma donna 
“Send that man away Send him off the ground It is 
impossible to play/’ and in a moment the newspaper seller 
was being driven off the central path Julie served The 
game continued The newsboy went, still shouting de- 
fiantly “Groote zeeslag bij Jutland* Engelsche neder- 
laag*” “Great Naval Battle British Defeat ” 

Did Julie hear? Perhaps she heard nothing It’s as if 
she were playing inside a glass tank, Lewis thought, 
sealed against the world, sealed against all emotion — she 
is so cold and set Her successes she did not pause to 
observe, even a failure was marked by no word, no check, 
no sign Her racquet swung, the ball flew In her face was 
neither satisfaction nor impatience, only the composure 
of an accepted ordeal, a fierce ritual that was not a game 
“Magnificent, Julie!” Ramsdell said, passing the end of 
the net as they changed over She did not reply She 
seemed not to be aware of him She is playing without 
knowing that she is playing, Lewis said 
The Baron was beside him, gripping his arm, with the 
other hand gripping Ballater’s 
“I’ve heard the news,” he said “You, of course, have 
heard it ” 

“Yes, sir ” 

“Believe me, I feel it as if it were my own inheritance 
I love England ” And he added with quiet humility “But 
not as you love her That goes without saying ” His voice 
trailed away, the voice of a very old man “But I make no 
doubt, gentlemen, it was a gallant battle 99 
He stood between them, his arms fallen limp at his sides, 
his head moving to and fro with the game 
“I could wish for you,” he said “that you were m your 
own country at this time ” 

She has no country, Lewis thought 
In Portsmouth, when the surviving ships came in, the 
crews must have landed among crowds that stood m in- 
credulous, agonized, pitying silence In imagination, he 
walked with the crews, his uniform a mark for pity, a

badge of failure In imagination he stood among the crowd, 
staring at the impossible defeat “What has happened?” 
the children were asking — the smallest children even, 
aware that the world had fallen about them, were asking 
it with their eyes No one answered them No one dared 
to say with his lips England has been defeated at sea 
When the tennis match was over and they ceased to 
stare at it, when the respite of its whipped excitement 
was spent, its tension broken, they would turn away from 
the court into a world changed m all things Voices would 
be changed and eyes, the air would have a different taste, 
and time, weighted with dead pride, a different measure 
Death is the incredible cessation of familiarity A cup is a 
different cup because the dead cannot use it again, a 
window cannot be looked from because the dead will 
never again darken it Strange cup, strange window, 
strange, persistent, assaulting clock, strange sea and 
meadows, strange world with empty hands, expression- 
less eyes A void suddenly An emptying away of life 
Now m England is the death of the one absolute assurance, 
the faith of all men’s childhood 
But now, with that death m their hearts, all Englishmen 
are one The disaster is irretrievable, by a miracle it shall 
be retrieved That spirit, which, in the first August, ran 
through England like the shiver of passion m the blood, 
moves again m her, a spiritual pulse that victory could 
never have stirred “I could wish for you that you were m 
your own country at this time ” Julie has no country, 
Lewis thought Even m the hour of death, she is outcast, 
even from die community of despair 
“Three straight sets*” 

“Brava 1 Brava* Brava*” 

“Poor Sophie*” 

“But Julie has never played like that before It’s as 
if ” 

“Brava! Brava* Brava! My God, what’s she doing?” 
“She’s going on*” 

“She’s waiting to serve ” 

“Well, but — doesn’t she know the game’s finished?”

Ramsdell went over to her and touched her She looked 
at him, recognized him, dropped the balls she held in her 
hand She was crossing the court Her face, brilliant with 
suffering, advanced out of the crowd 
“Levis, take me away Take me now — away ” 



CHAPTER SEVEN 

They had been so long silent m the car which brought 
them from Rynwyk that, when they reached the gate of 
the cottage, they seemed to be locked m silence 
While the car had been moving, and the white streak of 
road had continuously widened and engulfed them, and 
elms, sweeping up from the miniatures of distance, had 
continuously stretched at the sky and tossed their heads 
and disappeared, while he could see, whenever he looked 
down, her hand curled over the edge of the leather cushions, 
gripping them, vibrating, lying there always as if it would 
never be lifted, Lewis had been reposed m time’s little 
suspense, which is speed — speed that says you may rest 
until I have done with you, then take up life again They 
had sat side by side without speaking and without know- 
ledge that they were not speaking 
When the car stopped, the trees became still, peering 
down, the road stiffened and the birds asked quick, fluting 
questions of the air The air, which had been a rushing 
wind that swept thought backward like the long hair of a 
runner, lapped gently on forehead and wrist and cheek, 
and waited She stirred m her place, her hand no longer 
interrupted the high light on the polished leather, which 
lay empty, awaiting another passenger She alighted and 
stood and waited, the driver turned his head to look at 
them and at the sky, and silence welled up out of their long 
silences and imprisoned them 

She stood near by while the chink of money handed to 
the driver mingled with the lisp of the hedgerow, and 
Lewis was awkward with the coins, it seeming strange to

him that they should be there now, hard and warm from 
his pocket, milled on the edge or with the oihness of 
nickel, like other coins at other times The car would drive 
away with a little spit of rubber and fine gravel — one of 
those common sounds which, like the slither of a nickel 
coin, one doesn’t notice in dreams — and its going would 
be his signal He would turn and find himself alone with 
her 

When he turned, and the spit of gravel, an echo from a 
distant past of thought, was m his hearing, she was already 
advanced up the drive Her back was towards him and her 
shadow was curling over the pebbles and over the low, 
grassy bank at the edge of the wood bordering the garden 
ft was easier to pass her than to walk into the cottage at her 
side, so heavily would their silence hang over them if they 
went m together, and he strode past her, saying m his 
mind I’ll go first I’ll lead the way, but saying m words 
nothing ‘Til lead the way” — as if they were going into a 
dark place, as if the passage and the stairs were dark Below 
him, when he was on the stairs, he heard her say ‘Til 
leave my racquet here, Lewis Remind me when I go?” 
and he remembered that she was m a white frock and a 
soft white coat and carried a racquet like other women at 
other times 

In the sittmg-room he moved a chair for her, but she 
went beyond him to the window and stood by it looking 
out, a being, in her white dress, of more substance than his 
imagining of her, of more substance than her surroundings 
m this familiar room, grown now unfamiliar and ghostly, 
and he trembled m the thought that she was indeed present 
with him in the body, that her mmd also was filled with 
expectation of what their silence must yield, that she too 
was feeling, with his own incredulity of the senses, the 
touch of sleeves on her arms, the weight of her clothes 
upon her, the thousand fragmentary contacts that were 
marking for him the tension of those instants Soon they 
would sit down and try to talk calmly together She would 
sit with her elbows on her knees, her hands clasped before 
her, her eyes looking out over her hands — the familiar

attitude which, though not distinguishable m form from 
the attitude held by a thousand others who had the same 
trick of clasping their hands before them while they 
talked, was yet her own, having upon it the mark of her 
character, the unique imprint of her grace Thus she had 
sat long ago, when she was a child He saw her long, black- 
stockinged legs, her wrists thrust forward out of buttoned 
cuffs, her long hair, divided at her neck, hanging vertically, 
a double curtain to her face Thus she would sit now, he 
thought, but while the image was in his mind she said 
without turning 

“Now we’ve escaped, Lewis, there’s nothing either of 
us can say ” And when he had crossed the room and was 
standing behind her, she added “It’s because we haven’t 
really escaped, isn’t it?” 

“Yes, Julie ” 

“But if it weren’t for me, you might escape It’s possible 
for you — even now ” 

“To become indifferent?” 

“To the casual things — yes To make a world of your 
own that the world can’t touch 0 Lewis, my dearest one, 
if you knew how little I want to burn and torment and 
destroy you,” she said, turning towards him but not look- 
ing into his face “I want peace, for you and for me, 
and, if not for me, then still for you Do you remember 
that night at the Castle — Sophie’s birthday — going m to 
dinner I felt suddenly that because you had come into 
Holland I wasn’t alone any more It was all peaceful m me, 
then And m the months since, it has always been easy to 
pass to and from you — to you when I needed you, from 
you again when I chose Perhaps because I’d known you 
ages ago, I had set you apart from other men — and I loved 
you m a way, and I teased you, and I loved and I teased 
you because you were aloof, partly — a challenge, I 
suppose ” 

She was trying to laugh, to speak easily, as if of easy 
things, and Lewis touched her shoulders to check and 
steady her “Why should you tell me this now?” he said 
“It’s useless, Juke ”

“Because it’s true,” she answered, “as true as I can tell 
And because I’m telling myself while I tell you Even 
up to this afternoon, I was — what I've told you At least, 
I think so And when I came off the court, still I didn’t 
know I was frightened, everything had crashed I was cold 
and frightened and I came to you But in the car I knew 
that not you only but I — my God, Lewis, my dear, my 
beloved one, I never knew that I could be mad as I’m 
mad now ” Her voice had fallen “And even while I’m 
saying it, I know I don’t love you as you might some day 
love me ” 

“As I do love you, Julie,” he said 
She raised her eyes to him He saw fierceness and hunger 
m them that transformed her, making her at once so ter- 
rible and so beautiful that the little space between them 
seemed not to be a space, she seemed to be already in his 
arms and their bodies to be one body But he could not 
take her to him for she was aflame, as if he had struck her 
and she were waiting with fear and longing for him to 
stnke her again 

When she had moved from him and sat down, clasping 
her hands before her, she continued m a new voice “Half 
of me is worthless, more than half, I think, and you could 
never love me until you had made me anew ” And she 
smiled “You stand over me, watching me, as if there were 
no evil m me You think there is none m me, because there 
is none in you I could kneel down and worship you, but 
while I was kneeling I should be quivering for the touch 
of your hand and, if I hid my face m your shoulder like a 

child and took your strength from you, m mymind ” 

“Julie,” he cried, “you are telling lies of yourself Be 
quiet Say nothing You are saying things that will make 
you hate me for having heard them ” 

She would have spoken again and he lifted his hand 
towards her mouth as though to cover it, but his hand 
swept upward and he covered her mouth with his lips 
Far below him, he saw the whiteness of her dress break 
in the floor’s shadow, and he became still, searching for 
her individuality beneath the fiery cloud that had enveloped

her, seeking his love and knowledge of her within the 
agony of sensual confusion by which he was possessed 
With a low cry of the breath she fell from him and knelt 
upon the ground and sheltered her face m her hands 
“From the beginning, I knew From the very beginning 
I knew From the very beginning/’ she said, after a long 
silence 

She lowered her hands and stared before her, feeling 
that in some way which her most secret heart could not 
express she had lost the only companion of her life, and 
that the man standing above her was a stranger, that hence- 
forth only his body could be familiar to her, that she had 
driven out a spirit and was alone in the room and alone on 
earth She did not accuse herself, she had passed beyond 
accusation and judgement She was cold And into her cold- 
ness, like the run of colour in a tempering metal, there 
flowed the thought that while she was kneeling he would 
stoop and touch her, and hearing him move she shuddered, 
until at last she was lifted up 

Now, seeing that he was no stranger, that he had neither 
contempt for her nor pity, but love only such as she knew 
nothing of, she suffered herself to be gathered coolly into 
his arms and lifted her mouth to him m a wondering inno- 
cence that was to herself a mystery So gentle was he and 
so silent that tears came into her eyes, and when he re- 
leased her and would have her go from him, she gave him 
her hand and was led out like a child 

But m the Castle, alone, she saw, or thought that she 
saw, the truth, and she took a pen and wrote — m cruelty 
or renunciation or compassion or love — begging that he 
and she might never again meet, that he would go from 
Enkendaal She sent the letter by a servant instantly, that 
she might not recall it

CHAPTER ONE 

“Then Alison won’t come back,” van Leyden exclaimed 
when Ramsdell said that he was taking Lewis’s place in 
the cottage “What is the meaning of it? What’s he going 
to do with himself now?” 

“He is taking lodgings at Groenlmgen, three miles from 
Leiden,” Ramsdell began to explain “When he wants to, 
he can get m to the University ” 

Van Leyden swept his explanation aside 
“I know I know all about Groenlmgen A cousin of 
mine has an estate near by But taken lodgings, has 
he? Settled down? In his letter to me he said he was going 
to Leiden to get in touch with the University — there were 
books he wanted, scholars he wished to consult A few days 
m a hotel, I imagined, then back to Dirk’s papers But 

this sounds as though ” 

“I don’t know about that, sir,” Ramsdell replied hastily, 
taken off his guard and eager to support whatever excuse 
Lewis had given “Perhaps he does mean to come back ” 
The Baron greeted this with the whinnying noise that 
was provoked m him by all unreason There was not, he 
knew, comfortable room in Kerstholt’s cottage for more 
than two officers with their servants He turned on Ballater 
“If Alison had meant to come back, you wouldn’t have 
taken a new partner m your menage , eh? What have you 
done — quarrelled? You knew he would never come back — 
never Did you know, Julie?” The onrush of his irritation 
saved her from need to answer “All his work thrown away 
because of some silly quarrel between you young men I 
hate to have work interrupted I hate waste ”

His word “never” tingled in Julie’s mind as the return- 
ing blood tingles in a limb that has been dead, and stand- 
ing at her mirror one morning, still flushed by her waking 
dreams, she saw her face, so long impassive, so long remote 
from her like a stranger’s face, crumple, and tears grow m 
her eyes and overflow In an instant the tears were hot on 
the hands in which she hid her face, over the throbbing of 
her naked shoulders she could feel her hair’s movement 
She sank down beside her bed The floor was hard under 
her thigh, the scent of blanket in her nostrils 

That Lewis was gone, not to return, was of her own will, 
which was unchanged, she had said again and again The 
word “never” was of her own choice, and her reason did 
not revoke it But the idea behind the word, independent 
of will and reason, had now a terrible fertility m her 
imagination Shaken by a deep, slow sobbing, she seemed 
to herself to be crying aloud, but she made no sound and 
at last the convulsions of her body ceased Emotion was 
emptied from her, her limbs slackened, she began to know 
her own paroxysm, and criticize and be ashamed of it 
Lifting her head, she saw the shadowed clefts and bulging 
whiteness of the pillow above her, the tapestried hangings 
of the bed, the flattened vaulting of the roof, and for an 
instant observed with wonder and anger the girl crouched 
at the bedside whose abandonment was a denial of the 
control traditionally hers She rose, commanded herself, 
bathed, dressed, and went down to breakfast with her 
mother and Sophie 

“What are your plans for to-day, dear?” 

“I shall ride after breakfast,” she decided, and, having 
rung for Jacob, ordered her horse 

“You will nde with a groom, Mevrouw?” 

“Alone ” 

“Good, Mevrouw ” 

Her mother, who was reading a letter, said without 
looking up from it 

“It’s hot to nde, dear Don’t tire yourself ” 

And Sophie added “You look pale, Julie Didn’t you 
sleep well?”

In the hall, while she waited for her horse to be led 
round from the stable, she moved her toe within her boot, 
invisibly tapping her impatience She had sent out orders 
while she breakfasted, and now nothing was prepared She 
remembered how once, m Prussia, Rupert had been com- 
pelled to wait for his horse, and with what a sudden out- 
break of fierceness he had turned on the groom “They 
expect it It is necessary,” he had said to her afterwards, 
“because they expect it For no other reason Violence is as 
distasteful to me as to you — more distasteful, perhaps,” he 
had added with a shrewd smile and a glance that searched 
her eyes “The English are not so mild as their polite 
manners suggest ” He had tapped her shoulder and kissed 
her “Particularly English women ” Remembering this 
now as she looked out over the garden and the lakes, she 
felt behind her eyes and in her throat and breasts that 
stabbing of needle points which was, in her, the prelude to 
anger, and she knew not whether she was angry with the 
groom for his delay or was whipped by the memory of her 
husband’s custom of tapping her shoulder How serious he 
had been 1 How serious with her always, though with 
others he could be gay and light-hearted If he had played 
at love, she too might have played and been happy “But 
you are not pretty as other women are,” he had said 
once “You are beautiful, Julie, and for me you are 
sacred ” Sacred 1 She had mocked the word when he 

had first spoken it “Sacred He had taken her 

hand and kissed it with a tender embarrassment, and had 
frightened her by saying “Into thy hands, I commend 
my spirit ” 

She remembered how the deep, still passion with which 
he spoke had made even these extravagant words seem 
simple and unextravagant, and with what gentleness he had 
for her sake tried to smile them away They had smiled at 
each other and she had turned from his eyes, for she had 
felt that his love was making of her what she was not She 
had feared his worship of her and his gentleness more than 
she would have feared any brutality m him, they had 
seemed to demand that she should outgrow her nature

and be by his need and his imagination transmuted against 
her will 

Now, at this distance of time, when he had become for 
her a phantom, and their life together, though it might 
some day be resumed, a fragment of experience separated 
from her present knowledge of herself, she was able to 
obscure the power he had once had over her by thinking I 
was a child and his solemnity overawed me She could let 
him slide away from her mind She could read his letters as 
though they were letters found m some old drawer, not 
written by a living man or addressed to her 

Why, then, am I made angry by recollection of his 
touch? she said, and, hearing the scutter of a horse’s hoofs 
in the gravel, she remembered that it was the groom’s 
delay that had roused her impatience But the horse was so 
beautiful when he stood before her with the sun flowing 
over the silk of his flanks, and the stooping groom who 
mounted her grinned with such friendly complacence, that 
her anger was disarmed, and, seeing the man stand back 
to admire her — cap m hand, she felt even his admiration 
glow m her as she rode away 

At last, she thought, when she reached the moors and a 
scented breeze came to her from the pme-woods, at last I 
am myself again She was glad that she had sent Lewis 
away She was even a little contemptuous of him for having 
so readily obeyed her What she had intended when she 
wrote her letter was still clear m her mind to put from her 
the madness of the body that had beset her beneath his 
touch and m the shadow of his touch Neither conscience 
nor fear nor the rule of her marriage had impelled her to 
write, but an intuitive resistance to an invasion of herself 
Her decision had had as much and as little reason m it as 
the struggling thrust with which she would have striven to 
liberate herself from a hood drawn down suddenly over 
her head In the cottage she had been powerless to resist 
The thing had possessed her, for that reason she had 
driven it back when she might It was stronger than she, 
therefore she had put it from her Now she was free of it, 
she thought 



CH I 


THE PLIGHT 


191 

But above the rhythm of the horse the rhythm of her 
emotion continued, and she could not resist asking herself 
whether, if she had been free, she would have consented to 
marry Lewis In the idea of herself as his wife there 
appeared (under her smile) an incongruity which — but the 
thought sped away from her There had been no question 
of marriage, the love between them need have been no 
more than a shared interlude in their separated lives — a 
delicious game of love without real consequence, without 
solemn commitment, like the love m a play which is 
enchanted by its isolation Without commitment, she 
repeated, and began to think of it with guiltless, almost 
frivolous, delight, as if the pleasures promised by it were 
the irresponsible pleasures of a dance or a kiss, sensual, 
gay, of their own hour, to be taken, enjoyed, passed over, 
forgotten The imagining, because it was at once guiltless 
and sensual, caressed her as the sun caresses a naked body 
Her eyes brightened, her lips parted, she was possessed by 
a sense of well-being and lightness of heart 

In the sparkle of impulse she had forgotten Lewis 
Now she saw him before her as she had seen him m the 
cottage, and knew that, between him and her, love could 
never have been as she had been imagining it — a brilliant 
interlude without commitment Recognizing the depth 
and pregnancy of his love for her, she was suddenly 
pierced by an enraptured fear such as she had never before 
known Her husband also had had power to transmute 
her, to demand that m him she should surpass her own 
nature, but against his evocative influence she had fought 
stubbornly She did not wish to resist Lewis but to yield 
to him, to increase to the stature of his imagining of her, 
to become his peace and reconciliation, not his torment 
For an instant she permitted in herself recognition of this 
desire, then, with glittering eyes, repelled it She was glad 
that he was gone, glad to be free When, m the cottage, he 
had held her m his arms, he might, if this had been their 
destiny and his will, not have released her But the instant 
had dropped into the past, she beheld it sinking as a stone, 
with diminishing gleam, sinks through clear water The

instant was gone, she would think no more of it, but would 
think — the edge of her rein bit under her fingers, deep 
shadows of the pme-wood through which she was riding 
wheeled and bowed and parted before her with sedate 
mockery, and she remembered how the wayside elms, on 
the road from Rynwyk, had stooped and danced while 
he and she were driving towards the cottage But she 
would not think of the cottage or of how her arms would 
have fallen to her sides as she swayed under his compul- 
sion, and the window behind his shoulders have slid down- 
ward beyond her seeing until Her imagination was 

reversed m anger against him Her horse, emerging from 
the pme-wood, swung from trot to canter, from canter to 
gallop She felt his body stretch under her The wind of his 
movement streamed m cool rivulets under the lobes of her 
ears and swirled upward into the edges of the hair on her 
neck She drew rem gently, allowing the rhythm to break 
like the dying of a sea, and when the horse was trembling 
under her and his steam was spurting between the gloved 
fingers with which she stroked his neck, she began to say 
that she would write to Lewis so that there might be no 
more expectation in their silence She would say — but it 
would be better not to write, for, if she wrote, he would 
certainly reply, and to receive a letter from him She 
drew herself up in the saddle and rode leisurely homeward 


One evening of mid-June, about a fortnight after the 
battle of Jutland, Allard and his wife and the burgomaster 
of Rynwyk dined at the Castle 
Before gomg down to dinner Julie read a second time 
a letter that had been delivered to her during the day 

Rustoord, Groenlingen, 
Near Leiden, 16 th June 

My dearest Julie, 

Since I came here I have been telling myself that 
we must leave each other in peace That is why I haven’t

written But I can’t endure that our parting m the cottage, 
which we did not know was a parting, should be followed 
by no word but your little note asking me to go To-day 
I thought perhaps this cold, blank silence eats into her as 
into me I imagined you alone in the Castle, wondering 
why I had gone without saying good-bye, thinking perhaps 
that I went m a mood of bitterness or because I believed 
love between us to be a sin None of this is true, Julie dear, 
it is the opposite of the truth 

What has been going on m my mind since I left Enken- 
daal I will not tell you now If I tried to tell you, I should 
write what I must not write or, trying to be calm, should 
become your schoolmaster, floundering m philosophical 
autobiography — and you would laugh at me O Julie, to 
hear your laughter again, even your mocking laughter that 
used to sting me 1 

But though, if that is your will, we may not meet again 
for many years, I want our parting to be a gentle one, 
clear m our own decision and untormented in memory, 
not clouded by an embittering silence, and I will say once 
that I love you — not that m a passionate instant only I 
was enchanted, but that I love you with all my heart — 
with a love, hidden m me, I think, since we read of 
Nausicaa together, that all my knowledge of myself 
strengthens and lightens and confirms I am not torn and 
confused I have been, but am not now I love you and 
must say so, that you, knowing, may judge What there 
was m me before is enriched and quickened by you, what 
has come into my life now is yours always, though you 
put it from you, because you have given it to me And I 
ask for nothing except that, whatever way you take, know- 
ledge of my love may go with you 

Forgive me if I do wrong m sending this letter It is 
the last, unless some day, m peace of mind, you write to 
me Do not, m any case, answer for a little while Perhaps, 
m your own wisdom, do not answer at all Lewis 

She put the letter away m a drawer of her writing-table, 
but its voice remained an undercurrent of her mind While

she dined, phrases from it came to her out of the conversa- 
tion that surrounded her — a conversation principally m 
French, for the burgomaster was French by sentimental 
allegiance, being one of those Dutchmen who are not 
content to be Dutch After dinner, m the long room where 
coffee was served, he lifted his eyes over his cigar and said 
that Madame de Narwitz — if she would permit an old 
bachelor his privilege — grew lovelier every day, like the 
princesses m the fairy-books 
“But to become lovelier implies a change,” she said 
“What change do you see?” 

“Well,” he began, “this evemng ” 

“No, do not tell her of this evening,” Sophie interrupted 
“You will pay her compliments and that will be dull Tell 
her what she was before you began to read the fairy-tale 
That will be interesting You dined here on the evening 
before the tenms tournament What was she like then?” 

“Shall I tell you?” he said to Julie, patting her hand in 
what he hoped would pass for a fatherly manner “Then, 
my dear lady, you were the Sleeping Beauty Now you are 
Beauty awake Tell me what has awakened you?” 

“Have you forgotten the fairy story?” Julie said 
“A prince?” 

She laughed “But of course 1 ” 

“But where is he?” 

“Do you not see him reflected m my eyes?” 

He threw back his head with admirable good humour 
and exclaimed m Dutch “Myself 1 Ha* That is good* That 
is very good* How I wish it were true — if again you will 
permit a confirmed bachelor his privilege ” 

“The miracle you see can have been caused only by 
your presence,” she replied, “for I am sure it exists only 
in your imagination ” 

“Well said* Well said*” he cried “Did you hear that, 
Leyden? It is worth being snubbed with an eighteenth- 
century grace ” He laid his hand to his mouth, and behind 
it said to Julie in a chuckling, shrewd aside “If you weren’t 
bo clever and so pretty I should almost believe you ” 
During the long, tedious evening on the balcony, while 



CH I

195 

she gazed at the glowing tips of three cigars and listened 
to a laborious discussion between Sophie and Allard's wife 
on the propagation of tulips, Julie wondered whether there 
was indeed a visible change m her and whether a purpose- 
ful curiosity underlay the old burgomaster’s compliments 
But soon her only thought of the burgomaster was that 
the light from the room behind him had set a supremely 
ridiculous aureole on his bald, tufted head For his curi- 
osities and for Sophie’s keen suspicions, she ceased to care 
The tormented mood of that morning had gone from her, 
Lewis no more appeared m her visual imagination, but he 
was present in the lassitude of her body, the delicious lull 
of her mind, the dreamlike indifference to all external hap- 
penings by which she was possessed When she moved 
from the balcony to make the tea that Jacob brought m at 
ten o’clock, and held, crooked over her finger, the curled 
silver spoon which she found embedded among the leaves, 
the scent of the tea and the energy of steam rising like 
a pennon from the kettle seemed to be parts of herself, 
she was fascinated by their intimacy, by their weaving of 
themselves into the texture of her own emotion, and a little 
sigh of delight and sadness broke from her which surprised 
her hearing and made her smile Was she delighted or sad ? 
She did not know She was alive with a secret life mde- 

1 >endent of joy and of unhappiness, and when, after the 
lghts of the burgomaster’s car had swept the avenue with 
gold, she went to her room m the tower, she began to 
write to Lewis with no thought but that he was at her side, 
waiting for her to speak to him and touch him “My dear 
Lewis, This evening ” But there was a gap to be bridged 
between this evening and her last meeting with him To 
see her pen check on the paper was to perceive the gap 
I will leave him in peace, she said It is better that we 
should leave each other in peace She held the paper to her 
candle and let it burn — like an actress on the stage, she 
thought suddenly But m life there is always more paper, 

she added with a smile Nothing is final except How 

the edges of the paper wrinkled and sparked* A charred frag- 
ment rested on her forearm, so light that, when she closed

her eyes, she could not feel it there, and when she opened 
her eyes it was gone Was there moon enough to see the 
water and the island? In an embrasure, feeling the warmth 
of her blood drawn into the cool stone against which she 
was leaning, she thought that to-night she would have liked 
to dance and hear music, not the whisper of her own solitary 
clavichord, but the sparkle of a harpsichord or the brilli- 
ance of violins She would have liked to dance for long 
hours by candle-light, and m the morning, when she was 
tired, with the echo of music growing tired m her mind, 
stnp and swim in the lakes about sunrise, watching the 
island afloat among straws of golden crystal, feeling the 
drag of cold water under the thrust of her str iking arm 



CHAPTER TWO 

In the Library, 
Enkendaal, 
Saturday , 26 th October 

My dear Lewis, 

Your pen, your ink, your paper, your table, your 
library, and so there must be a letter to you before I climb 
my own staircase m the wall up to my own room Whether 
you find it or not will depend on how much interest you 
still have in Descartes by the time he reaches you Rams- 
dell told me to-day that, when he visited you, you spoke 
about the volume of Descartes with Dirk’s notes in it, and 
just now when I was undressing I remembered So I came 
down to find it I don’t know if you really want it Perhaps 
Pm only using it as an excuse to end this long silence smce 
you went Sometimes I wonder why you did go When I 
wrote, I think I expected you to disobey me At any rate, 
though I wished you to go and perhaps expected you to, 
I didn’t imagine you gone, I didn’t imagine the summer and 
the autumn passmg without you Bless you, Lewis dear 
My hand is cold and all trembling — this library is like an 
ice-well I haven’t said anything I wanted to say I haven’t 
even told you why I didn’t answer the letter you wrote in 
June Need PI love you Bless you and good-night I’m 
happy and miserable and shaky Perhaps you will never 
find this — and perhaps that would be best I don’t know

My dearest Julie, 

Why did you send it in a booh? I might never have 
found it— was that why? I suppose it was 
Three weeks ago I came in from a long walk to find on 
my table a parcel addressed in Ramsdell’s handwriting 
Inside it was Dirk’s volume of Descartes with a letter from 
Ramsdell saying he had taken it for me from the Castle 
library and that I must return it to him when I’d done with 
it I wasn’t in a mood for Descartes, I had passed on to 
other books and other thoughts since Ramsdell visited me 
here, and I put the book on the window-sill, where it was 
soon hidden in the mass of stuff that accumulates m these 
little lodgings of mine Now and then I have a grand clear- 
ance I began one to-night and found Descartes That was 
the end of my housemaiding I sat down to read Your 
letter tumbled out on my knees 
Your writing 1 1 remember the first letter I had from you 
— in the fort I didn’t know you, but even then I could not 
escape from the mystery of your letter — a letter from a 
ghost that I could see and yet not see, your hand on the 
paper, your pen forming the words under my eyes, your 
eyes looking at them And now — O Julie, to have lying 
before me now, on my table within reach of my hand, 
a letter from you* It’s as if you were in the room More 
than that — as if the secret of you, the deepest essence, 
were with me but intangible — the scent of unseen flowers 
entering an open window suddenly You wrote from the 
library, cold, at night But though I can perceive the cold 
and the dark, my imagination does not accept them only 
I see you sitting on the library floor, the sun on you, while 
we talked of the seventeenth century, I see you moving 
with a candle from shelf to shelf with the shine of it m 
jour hair and shadow flowing and leaping at your feet, I 
see you under the trees watching the tennis, coming off die 
court, sitting at my side as we drove up from Rynwyk, 
walking ahead of me up the path leading to the cottage 
and all these imaginings are one imagining from which

you emerge, the quintessence of a thousand meditations, a 
reality greater than the reality of one thing seen 

There has been a gap m my letter — three hours and 
more I couldn’t go on I have been walking in the meadow 
outside the house, where the trees are crackling in a frosty 
wind as though the branches were hung with icicles And 
I have been staring at your letter and staring at the lamp 
and still I can’t easily go on I don’t know your calm mind, 
Julie I don’t know what you would have written if you 
had written to me — not to Descartes 

I will tell you why I went away more than five months 
ago Partly because you were a woman and the choice was 
yours — a conventional reason, partly for another reason 
that was my own I can write of it coolly now, then there 
was little left to either of us but intuition Your intuition 
was to send me away You wrote your letter at once, 
without hesitation, you didn’t think it out — you sat down 
and wrote, within an hour Jacob had brought it to the 
cottage My intuition confirmed yours I could not see I 
knew that our love had become a greater or a more trivial 
thing than either had formerly understood — all or nothing 
But I could not see or distinguish I felt, but could not 
judge 

Love, friendship even, every intimate association be- 
tween two people has, I believe, an underlying substance — 
think of it as a separate personality (the metaphysicians, if 
you’ll forgive them, would call it a hypostasis) — which is 
distinct from their separate personalities, though it has 
proceeded from their mingling To betray or confuse or 
corrupt or belittle it is the unforgivable sin So I believe 
I do not believe that the bodily delight of love is a sm, 
but that it becomes a deadly betrayal wherever a human 
relationship is obsessed by the acceptance, or by the de- 
sire, of it Either you and I were by our discovery of each 
other made gods with power to create, in our relationship, 
a perdurable essence, higher than ourselves, independent 
of our delights, or we were animals caught in a trap Either 
our beings would grow, and move towards peace and still- 
ness through our love and because of it, or be wasted in a

trivial passion Our love was a predestined force that would 
create of itself a personality — a hypostasis — more beauti- 
ful and vital and lasting than ourselves, or it was a sterile 
pleasure, no more I wanted to know and judge of our- 
selves I say “ I wanted to know and judge ” — then I

to you, I cannot mend either part of it Even what your 
schoolmaster has written your lover has thought, that must 
pardon its stiffness I said once that I would not try to

My dear Lewis, 

Thank you for your letter — such a strange letter, 
too, I imagine you writing it m your lodgings with books 
and papers round you m such heaps that you can scarcely 
see over them — into the world 
You tell me nothing of your work I often think of you 
and the seventeenth century when I sit down to play on 
my clavichord I don’t play it often now The evemng is 
generally my time for playing, and often when I come to 
bed the fire is out, or almost out, m my little music-room 
The weather is becoming very cold Perhaps we shall be 
skating soon 

Some day, when you have nothing better to do, write 
and tell me how your book progresses I shall always be 
interested m that I suppose you will be a great man some

puzzle your biographer almost as much as it has puzzled 

Julie 

Enkendaal, 

Lewis dear, Friday 

I wish I hadn’t sent that silly letter It seemed so 
clever to me when I had written it I was angry I am 
always being made angry by you— just because I am so 
intolerably young, I suppose, and should really be happier 
if I were being made love to by little men who amused me 
and excited me and didn’t make me feel as you do — and as 
my husband did m his different way — that the world is so 
much older than I am I want to play and be happy for a 
little while — that’s all, so you mustn’t think I’m more than 
I am and must try to forgive me 

Because that isn’t really all That’s the part of me that 
was made angry by your letter But you know there’s 
another part that was frighteningly proud because it was 
you that had written it The austerity and quietness of it 
were you, really you That’s why I locked it away Not for 
your biographer 

My own reply went off by last night’s post Now it’s 
early morning I crept down into the hall just now to see 
if my letter was still on the table, I should have taken it 
back, but it had gone And it’s too early to get up, so I’m 
writing this m bed, by daylight and candle-light — half and 
half 

I suppose our lives, yours and mine, are utterly different 
Some day I shall go back to Prussia and settle down some- 
how with enormous dogs all round me, and I shall have 
to play cards, and we shall go to Berlin for a part of the 
year and to Munich for music and pay visits m the Black 
Forest Of course everything may be different Rupert has 
been wounded a second time, I don’t know how badly, he 
says it isn’t serious, but he says I’m not on any account to 
go to him After the war, he tells me, we shall be much 
poorer than we were, but I don’t know what that means—*

he is always very careful to say nothing about internal 
conditions an Germany except that the “people are bearing 
everything with wonderful loyalty ” I don’t know how 
serious it is for people like us I should hate to be poor, 
even moderately poor, m Germany To me, as I remember 
it, it’s all like an old-fashioned play, and in a play one must 
have the lead 1 And you will go on with your own life — 
Chepping and a dusty, mky office in Fells Square Or shall 
you be able to give up the publishing business? I suppose 
that, like everything else, depends on how the war ends 
My maid came in to draw my curtains and was sur- 
prised to find me sitting up m bed She has firmly taken 
my candle away There is economy m candles, she says 
Anyhow, I don’t need it any more 

And so a new day begins How lovely it would be if you 
were here I What came afterwards for me m Germany and 
for you m England wouldn’t matter so much, would it? 
I should be able to forget there was a future, I think, 
but you wouldn’t — and I love you the more because you 
wouldn’t Dear Lewis, remember me sometimes when it’s 
all over and I’m m Germany with the dogs and the cards 
And try to think that, though it may be the worthless part 
of me that wants you here now, it’s not the worthless part 
that loves you — perhaps a little as you would wish to be 
loved Write to me sometimes — a lecture on metaphysics 
or a lesson m Greek will do I’ll take it out with me on to 
the moors, and when I’m an old, old woman I shall unlock 
it and read it again and remember the smell of this candle- 
wick and that it’s breakfast-time and I’m not dressed

I haven’t answered your two letters, Julie, my dearest.

To live alone as I do here, falling into bed after hours 
of silence and waking to silence again, is to acquire a new 
perceptiveness Silence is not silent, you begin to hear and 
feel the growth of natural things, your finger seems to lie 
on the pulse of earth herself Often I went into the grave- 
yard at Chopping when I was a boy, for I thought Not 
this man or that woman, as they were in life, looks up at 
me through the grass, but beings who, in their long dark- 
ness and silence, have learned to see and hear as they could 
not on earth If they are reconciled with the roots of trees 
and the bulbs of flowers and have heard the first movement 
of water under ground and have a community with the 
swiftness of fallen birds, rotted and buried from the eyes 
of men, certainly they must hear me, though I say nothing, 
and understand me, though all my thought is troubled 
and in confusion And as I imagined then that the dead 
felt and saw, so I am beginning now to see and feel A 
voice from the outside world stirs me as the wind a harp- 
string And I seem less to hear what is said and to interpret 
it m its own terms than to receive the essence of the speaker 
That is why I wrote what made you angry 

You are in this room with me now more closely than 
you have ever been Your presence enters into me and 
becomes a part of me And if I say only that I love you, 
I am using language of which my life has outrun the 
meamng One loves what is external to oneself and you 
have ceased to be external to me Yet there is no other 
language I may use, and the words arise again and again — 
I love, I worship, I desire 

I am filled with thoughts that delight and bum me, but 
I am filled also with expectation of such a tranquillity as 
I have always dreamed of The burmng thought and the 
tranquil expectation are enemies now, but they are inter- 
locked without one, the other could not be fulfilled, and 
I would not have it otherwise 

When I think of returning to you, and of your receiving 
me, and of the miracle of seeing with my eyes the bodily 
presentment of what you have become within me, all my 
memories and half-memories of happiness, all my long-

mgs for appeasement of beauty, rise up to be fulfilled It 
is very strange that I did not know I loved you when you 
were a child There was a quality m you then which, with- 
out my understanding it, has always stood between me and 
any love but yours When first I came to Enkendaal, almost 
a year ago, I did not know this, but I felt, when I saw you, 
an indescribable anguish of remoteness and loss You 
belonged to a different world, you were very young, very 
gay, very scornful, with a brilliant arrogance, you made 
me feel stiff and old, I saw myself in the flash of your in- 
difference, I knew — though the knowledge did not express 
itself in my thought — that it had become finally impos- 
sible that you should love me And now you love me 
In your first letter, m the Descartes, you told me this, 
but the words were like a song over the mountains they 
seemed not intended for me When you told me again, m 
this letter written bj, morning candle-light, suddenly the 
words were whispered m my ear and I could hear no other 
sound on earth They shut out all else I wrote to you m a 
madness — from the burning core of my thought, that 
letter I didn’t send — I didn’t finish it 

Still the imagination of your beauty is an epitome of 
every impulse of my senses since I became man But the 
flame is not all of me nor all of you As lovers, we may 
pass through and beyond it, not by its failure but by our 
supremacy over it If this is not true, then love is corrup- 
tion and there is no truth but in renunciation and no peace 
but in death, but m this world, truth resides m our per- 
ception of it Our own judgement is our fate, m this as m 
all else For those who, as I am, are freed — or exiled — 
from belief m immutable, divine commands, there is no 
rule against love, and no absolute duty of love but the 
duty to discover, and continually re-discover, its quality, 
whether it be a greed only and sterile or of the spirit and 
fruitful That is my belief, Julie You must judge of your- 
self as I of myself Lewis

My darling,

mean and shallow, and whatever I try to write seems use-

Julie 

Enkendaal, 

Wednesday , 27 th December 

Lewis dear, 

I think I can write now— at least, I’ll try to Such 
a long time, you’ll say* And it’s true, I’ve been deliberately 
putting it all out of my mind We’ve had people staying 
here for the skating, and then Ramsdell and Ballater and I, 
and Goof and Allard and Allard’s wife — and Sophie* — all 
went to Utrecht and joined up with another party there. 
We skated over the canals, miles and miles Lovely skat- 
ing* Have you ever used Dutch skates — a very fine knife- 
edge and loose under the heel You get a swing and rhythm 
you don’t get any other way It’s like playing music on the 
air 

We were away for three days, putting up m an hotel 
one night, and on two nights m country-houses where we 
picked up more people It’s a good winter for those who 
have fuel enough They were short in the cottage — m fact, 
they ran out altogether, but Ballater was so proud of his 
housekeeping that he wouldn’t say a word They lived 
a kind of secret Esquimaux life on an oil-stove until I 
found them sitting round it in greatcoats — Ballater ill and 
Ramsdell shivermgly looking after him like a hero I told 
Uncle Pieter Now he treats them as he treats the whole 
village, the whole Enkendaal estate No one there is ever 
allowed to shiver or be hungry Mother has thousands of 
eggs m pickle She gives them away — and much else — and

loves it! And Uncle Pieter cuts down his woods It’s some- 
thing to live on an estate where the landlord really does 
regard his landlordism as a sacred duty — or not even a 
duty, but as part of the natural, inherited obligations of the 
head of a vast family He won’t hear of subscriptions by 
other people or help from Rynwyk The Enkendaal people 
are his people When there’s need, everything he has is 
theirs— just as much as if they were his children They 
adore him, and the queer thing is that he’s scarcely aware 
that m this world he’s fast becoming unique 

All that sounds as if I were still putting off what I have 
to say But it’s all mixed up with what I’ve been thinking 
about — I mean, the difference between your world and 
mine For Rupert and Uncle Pieter are linked m a way, 
though utterly different as men If we come down to hard 
realities, I’m linked with them 

I know I’m often provocative and maddening — all hot 
and cold Now I’m going to strip myself of all that, as 
far as I can I must We’ve got to understand one another, 
Lewis Your letter, that makes me love you and fear you 
and fear what I’ve done to you, has so much more in it 
than there can ever be in me that it makes me feel little 
and ashamed I don’t deserve to be loved as you love 
me — or as Rupert loves me There simply isn’t the stuff 
in me unless people bigger than myself imagine it m me 
and draw me up, as it were, to their imagination, there’s 
something in me which responds to that — no more, Lewis 
dear But at least I can stop myself doing you a damnable 
wrong because I’ve let you misunderstand me This is 
going to be a candid letter, on my own plane — perhaps an 
unlovely letter, I don’t know, but a true one, because I do 
love you 

In the great world — I mean the international great 
world, Rupert’s, Uncle Pieter’s, mine too now — you don’t 
marry for love or, if you do, only exceptionally and by 
chance It’s not the rule, it’s not even the recogmsed ideal, 
as it is m professional, middle-class England No one 
expects you to That sounds very harsh, but it’s not un- 
reasonable and not at root umdeahstic There’s a difference 



CH II

of ideal, as there’s a difference of tradition, and I always 
believe that the value of ideals lies less in the nature of the 
ideals themselves than in the fact that people will suffer 
and discipline themselves and perhaps die for them, what- 
ever they are, good or bad Notions of good and bad 
change from age to age and between country and country 
There’s little that’s absolute except the power to stand firm 
by what you do believe in That seems good to me 
And you can’t keep property together and preserve a 
privileged and responsible class without always putting 
the necessities of the class and the family before the loves 
of the individual Particularly that’s true of a country like 
Holland, where all the property can't be left to one child, 
but must by law be divided and redivided The redivisions 
have to be cancelled out again and again by marriage 
settlements If the Leydens had married for love, though 
their sons might have brought in new wealth of their own 
making from Java and elsewhere, they’d have ceased to exist 
as a family Good or bad, their tradition would have gone I 
think it good — socially, morally, every way, but whether 
good or bad, there it is — it’s their ideal It’s what those 
who believe in it have to stand by, and do stand by, often at 
enormous sacrifice of their own inclinations Uncle Pieter 
married Mother for love, but not until he’d gone through 
years of self-denial and was a widower de convenance with 
heirs de convenance I’ve always felt as if I were a bastard 
child in this place It has often made me desperately un- 
happy, but I see their point 

The whole aristocratic tradition would smash if mar- 
riages weren’t still largely the affair of the family council 
It isn’t now, on the surface, as arbitrary as it was It 
doesn’t say Mademoiselle, you are to be married next 
Monday to Monsieur Un Tel, though to you he’s an 
ogre But it still counts the quartenngs and the hectares 
It doesn’t command and bully you any more, you can go 
to the rabble if you’ve made up your mind to it, but it 
makes it pretty clear to its young women that, though 
they needn’t marry a man they loathe, their choice is 
narrowly limi ted People who are not, as Uncle Pieter

quietly says, “one of us”, may scoff and may be genuinely 
disgusted They think of the aristocratic system as an 
unromantic greed for power and property or as mere 
empty snobbishness, but it’s not that, there’s too much 
sacrifice and suffering wrapped up m it, at heart, it’s much 
less snobbish and selfish than many so-called romantic 
marriages I respect it Anyhow there’s nothing mean, and 
something rather magnificent, about the self-subordina- 
tion, nowadays much more than half-voluntary, of the 
younger generation — girls particularly — a kind of tight- 
lacmg of their own impulses Girls particularly, because 
love outside marnage, which is an implied balance of the 
whole system, is still much harder for them — without 
bringing down the whole pack of cards 

I’m not going to bring it down, Lewis That’s what I’ve 
had to make myself say And it’s been hard for me to say 
because I’m still English enough to know and feel the 
arguments of the other side — that I won’t come into the 
open, that therefore my love for you must be selfish and 
contemptible, that I’m willing to deceive my husband and 
go on living with him afterwards because I know which 
side my bread is buttered If you see it m that light, you 
will despise me and not answer this That will be the end 
for us, and I suppose, if I am as hard-minded as I’m trying 
to be now, I shall call myself a fool ever afterwards for 
having written this letter instead of deceiving you But 
there’s the truth for you to judge me by I love you as I 
have never begun to love anyone But I don’t mean to 
break up my marriage By standards that are not mine, I 
may be “deceiving” my husband, though I never loved 
him or pretended to But I did go into my marriage, with 
my eyes open, on certain terms clearly implied — that I 
wouldn’t disgrace him openly or let his tradition down 
I stand by those terms and I should stand by them just 
the same if he became poor and had nothing to give me, 
and I’d stand by them even if I knew that he had taken 
mistresses 

Oh, my dearest one, I’m saying it all so badly It sounds 
so cold and calculating, but I’m trying to do m my own

world what you went away to do in yours — to see the whole 
thing plain, and, though I love you tormentingly and love 
you with all of myself, and sometimes so much that I’m 
ashamed of wanting you as I do, I know it’s true that, after 
this interlude — the war — is over, my husband and Ins 
world, which are my realities, as this love of yours and 
mine is a lovely, magic dream, will claim me again I shall 
go back, carrying with me one long, deep, happy secret — 
still the most precious thing m my life But I shall go back 
and live m that great castle of his and be not ashamed of 
my secret but proud of it There have been secret and 
passionate loves there before, he knows it, but he’s been 
so proud of telling me that there has never been an open 
scandal or any slur upon his race It’s a real pride, not 
petty and personal and jealous, but representative of much 
more than he is or I am I’ll not break it 

If he didn’t love me, I shouldn’t have a fragment of 
doubt It happens that he does And — this is harder to say 
than all the rest put together — that, to me, is the more 
reason for secrecy Every letter I have from him shows me 
— so that I can scarcely read them if I once remember that 
they are addressed to me y and that he’s real and not just a 
far-off, impossible ghost — every letter shows me that he 
loves me, or something he has imagined m me, more and 
more It’s horrible He has suffered so much And he’s 
built me up into a kind of idol m the midst of all the mess 
of his life and — but it’s all unreal, Lewis I don’t love him 
Sometimes I think he’s almost mad Perhaps he’ll go mad 
I don’t know But because he loves me, I’ll not hurt him 
personally, he needn’t know, he can’t ever know 

Now you know what I feel about the impermanence 
of our being together There are people who believe that 
love isn’t love that doesn’t contemplate an everlasting 
domesticity And there are people who believe that there 
are direct commandments from God which make love 
between us a mortal sin And there’s a whole world m 
England — your world, Lewis, I remember your moving 
m it with a queer air of being detached from it and 
yet of being tied to it — there’s a whole world of people

who think quite differently from me about all these things, 
and would be far more ready nowadays to forgive a woman 
who faced a public scandal in order to marry her lover 
than a woman who kept her secret They think of the 
scandal as a badge of courage — anyhow a mark of sincerity 
You have never told me what you feel about this Your 
letter is out of my reach sometimes I can’t apply it to 
what’s in my own mind Does it mean that what we do 
we are to do openly? Why do you love me? I am so different 
from you Do you love me ? Yes, but how? Tell me, please 
tell me, how we stand with the world I’m not a goddess, 
Lewis I’m very little of what you think me I’m a girl 
who loves you and wants to know what you expect of her 
Tell me, Lewis dear, and don’t despise me In my own 
way I’m trying to judge of myself

Groenlingen, 
Friday, 29th December 

Forgive me, Julie There was no need to wnte the letter 
you call unlovely, I ought to have made the answer clear 
long ago From the time when you were a brilliant, im- 
petuous child, I have known how far separated our worlds 
must always be I don’t mistake myself — or you It is not 
conceivable, unless a miracle were worked m both of us, 
that you could be happy as my wife My existence after 
the war, as I imagine it now, would be prison to you, and 
I am not made to be the gaoler of you or any woman If 
we are lovers, I shall enter into the legend for a little while, 
and a legend may continue though the book be shut and 
taken away Our care will not be an impossible reconcilia- 
tion with the world Our love will be ringed about m time, 
having a perfection which, when the ring is dissolved, will 
change its form but not cease to be 
Why do I love you, you ask, and m what way? It seems 
strange to you that I, who have so long cultivated solitude 
and austerity, should be able, without denial of myself, to 
love one whose life belongs, as yours does, to the world

It seems stranger to me, Julie, that you should love such 
a man as I That you should be interested by some quality 
of my mind and feel an affection, even a tenderness, for 
your schoolmaster, so little schooled in your graces, I can 
at least explain to myself Long ago you had affection for 
me, you were willing to be m my company, if you had a 
question to ask, you were eager that I and no other should 
answer it, you sought me out continually, though you were 
a child and I was a man, we were deep companions As 
we loved each other then, it is not inexplicable that we 
should love each other now But that you should love me 
m the way you do now love me is a miracle that makes 
me hide my eyes from thought It is as if I had suddenly 
discovered that the waves obeyed me 

How shall I tell you why I love you or with what manner 
of love? I know this — I know it now, though I did not 
know it with certainty when we parted — that my love is 
not a swerving from my purpose, but an enrichment and 
a balancing of it Since I have been here, with knowledge 
of you within me, I have looked back upon my two years 
m Holland and have begun to understand how often, and 
m what ways, I have been foolish and arrogant Often I 
have been most arrogant when I have believed myself to 
be full of humility, this is one of the great paradoxes by 
which all novices of the contemplative life have been beset 
Once only, on my last day m the fort, did I attain to a dis- 
tant perception of the way I must one day follow I felt 
as nature must feel m the first death of winter 
You are the death of another winter in me I looked for 
peace m solitude, it was thronged with prides and de- 
lusions I looked for truth within myself alone, but the 
truth, which is in all men, was frozen deep m me and I 
had no sun to discover it Now, because you love me, the 
winter of my soul moves from me and solitude is emptied 
of great perils There is no surprise more magical than 
the surprise of being loved, it is God's finger on man's 
shoulder There is no peace equivalent to the peace of 
loving, it is the sigh of a hated child who, laying his head 
upon his pillow, has consolation in sleep, passing from the

their luggage was not to be brought down, but unpacked, 
tlie Baron would go to the Hague alone 
“But I am going,” Julie said 
“You can’t Why should you go?” 

“Why should Uncle Pieter go alone? He hates being m 
towns alone ” 

He was at the window, the yellow skin of his forehead 
illuminated by the gleam of snow, his eyes screwed up 
against the dazzle of the ground and the metallic glistening 
of the sky 

“It’s true I hate towns,” he said “But I have to go 
Kind of you, Julie But don’t think of it It’s no weather 
for women ” 

“I want to go,” she said 

“It’s always the same with her,” Sophie put m “Any- 
thing to get away from Enkendaal ” 

The maid hesitated, uncertain of her orders, and the 
Baroness spoke with decision “Unpack all the luggage ” 
Julie, she thought, did not mean what she said 
“But I intend to go,” Julie exclaimed “I mean to go ” 
The blood came to her cheeks, a tremor ran across her 
shoulders, and, seeing van Leyden’s eyes shift at the dis- 
proportion of her emotion to its apparent cause, she under- 
stood, as she had not before, that to go to the Hague was 
not in her a whim but a necessity, the keeping of a pledge

which now she knew for the first time she had given What 
had she said in her letter? What, precisely? That she was 
going to the Hague, that Uncle Pieter had an appointment 
there on Friday, that they would go to concerts, pay calls 
But had she said that it was to-day, Wednesday, she should 
go? She had given no address there But Lewis would know 
to what hotel Uncle Pieter went always in the Hague 
The little dispute with her mother, Sophie’s trimmed, 
contemptuous smile, even the lingering gaze of the maid- 
servant withdrawing from the room, filled Julie with the 
zest of conspiracy, and, in the hall, while luggage was 
being carried out, she looked up from a shoe-string she 
had stooped to tighten and smiled and said “Shall we enjoy 
ourselves m the Hague, Uncle Pieter? I feel as if we were 
eloping ” 

The old man gazed at her “That grey fur makes you 
rosy,” he said, and, seeing her ankle “But you ought to 
have gaiters It is horribly cold Sophie would lend you 
gaiters ” 

In the train, because she was with him, he would not 
smoke His fingers pulled at his cigar-case and replaced it 
“But why not, Uncle Pieter? You do in the house ” 
“Not here,” he replied stubbornly 
“Because I’m with you?” 

He smiled his prejudice, but would not explain it 
“If I smoke a cigarette?” she said, and opened her bag 
“Ah, Julie* Not m public ” 

“But the carriage is empty ” 

He dragged his collar about his ears “As you will, then ” 
“You forbid?” she said, the cigarette between her 
fingers 

“I forbid nothing to women I ask sometimes ” 

She returned the cigarette, closed case and bag “As we 
have only begun to elope, I’ll obey,” she answered 
A smile, concealed at the mouth by his coat-collar, 
appeared in the wrinkles about his eyes 
That night, after the guests he had invited to dme with 
him at the Deux Villes were gone, they sat together m the 
hall, drinking tea

“What shall you do to-morrow, Uncle Pieter?” and 
while he told her his plans she thought To-morrow Lewis 
will come, perhaps to-night by a late train, and, hearing 
the door swing, she turned her head in delight and terror 
“What has become of Alison?” Uncle Pieter said 
He began to talk of Dirk van Leyden’s papers 
If it had been Lewis that had come m then, she thought, 
he would have been sitting now on that empty chair and I 
should have been saying We will order fresh tea But I 
should add Let us have it m our sitting-room, Uncle 
Pieter, it is cold here And perhaps, before it was time to 
say good-night, Uncle Pieter would go from the room for a 
moment, and for a moment we should say nothing, then, 
suddenly 

“It’s too cold for you here in that dress,” Uncle Pieter 
said “You are shivering Shall we go up to the sitting- 
room? We might play a game of piquet Unless you wish to 
go to bed at once?” 

“You love piquet?” 

“I am very fond if it ” 

“So am I We will play First I will have another cup of 
tea Then 

But though she sipped her tea until it was cold under 
her lip, the entrance-door did not swing again 
“You are playing piquet to please me,” the old man 
observed as they went upstairs together 
“Nonsense,” she replied with a smile “It’s a game that 
depends on one’s company It’s a perfect game for an 
elopement ” 

They stirred a poor fire and drew chairs close to it He 
shuffled the cards and, with his eyes on them, said 
“I wish you were happier at Enkendaal, Julie ” 

“I’m all nght, Uncle Pieter ” 

He shrugged his shoulders “Cut then, child ” 


While they played, she tried again to remember what had 
been the words of her letter Were they, in effect, an

implied invitation to Lewis to come to the Hague? She had 
not so intended them while she wrote Or had she? Would 
she not then have been more precise? She trembled to 
think that, reading into her words more than they con- 
tained, he had yet decided not to come, her cheeks paled 
m anger against him, then, feeling suddenly that he was 
on his way to her, that to-morrow his eyes would be on her, 
she was unable to play her hand and her weight fell upon 
the back and the arms of her chair 

<e Well? ,, said Uncle Pieter, and she began to play again, 
but had soon to confess that she was tired and go to her 
room All the next day, walking or driving m the snowy 
streets, listening m a concert hall to Bach whose intel- 
lectuality seemed now frozen and barren, visiting in a 
drawing-room where an attache of the German Legation 
bowed over her hand and awoke her suddenly by delaying 
his release of it, she was in an expectant dream, thinking 
that at the Deux Vtlles there might even now be a message 
for her The attache was a musician, he would, he said, 
play Debussy, for was not music international? The 
assembly was hushed, the last little golden chair had 
creaked and was still, when she, who was near the instru- 
ment, suddenly leaned forward and begged him m German 
to play, not Debussy, but Chopin 

“Chopin?” he said with scorn, dropping his hands on 
his knees, and she was so ashamed of her interruption 
that tears of humiliation and anger started m her eyes 
“I love Chopm,” she said like a stubborn child 
“Ah,” the German answered, “that makes of him a 
greater composer than I had understood ” 

Her wit had deserted her, she was silent, and the 
Nocturne he played stabbed her silence But presently she 
forgot the gilded chairs and the eyes turned upon her, the 
music and her love of it prevailed 

“You were right, Madame, he is a greater composer 
than I had understood,” the German said at last, taking a 
place beside her 

“You mean that? It’s generous of you I had no right to 
interrupt You really believe it?” 



THE FOUNTAIN

218 

“His beauty is established in its influence on your own 
I can read it m your face ” 

He left her before she could reply and afterwards would 
play nothing but Chopin He held her hand again w fare- 
well 

“You are staying m the Hague, Madame?” 

“I return to Enkendaal to-morrow ” 

“Alas 1 the greatness of Chopm will shrink when you are 
gone He will become a sentimental memory ” 

She smiled “Which is what you consider him?” 

“In your absence ” 

“Then you have been the more generous m my presence 
But how do you play so well work that you despise?” 

“I am a diplomat, Madame ” He kissed her hand again 
“And a desolate one Au revolt It is permitted to dream of 
the Nocturne, if not to play it?” 

“If I could command the dreams of diplomats,” she 
replied, “I should have Europe for my empire ” 

“Mon Dieu , Madame , le monde entier serait a peine assez 
grand pour votre empire ” 

She was warmed by his flattery, not because she valued 
it or because she failed to perceive his underlying con- 
tempt for her race and judgement, but because to be 
flattered was to exist, to feel herself existing, to throw off, 
if for a moment only, the sensation, which chiefly tor- 
mented her, of being a ghost with no place in the world 
Sitting m the hotel that evening before going out to dine, 
she tried to remember the sound of Lewis’s voice, but 
could not, his face also was indistinct in her imagination, 
she could recall nothing clearly except his grip on her 
shoulders, the grip of one who had become invisible, who 
was, perhaps, dead Dead? Or ill? Or gone away from 
Groenlingen? Perhaps her letter had been thrust under his 
door and was lying unopened She looked up at the porter’s 
desk, thinking that she would ask for a telegraph form, but 

to telegraph and receive no answer Her fingers 

tightened m her palm, and, having put away from her, m 
pride and fear, above all in weariness, the project of send- 
ing a telegram, she yet began to devise vain forms of words 



CH III 


THE FLIGHT 


219 


“Did you receive letter?” 

“Am in Hague Leaving Friday ” 

“Disregard letter ” 

“Please come ” 

“Don’t come now ” 

She could send no telegram There was nothing to 
say 

As though she had come out of a roaring tunnel into 
daylight and a relative quietness, she was suddenly able to 
be composed, to survey and criticize herself I am going 
mad, she thought I am behaving as people behave m news- 
papers and Elizabethan plays A wry smile moved on her 
lips, soon banished by a feeling of profound degradation 
Love, if this were love, was an ugly obsession, a screaming 
m the dark, and so far distant was the woman she had be- 
come from the girl she had known herself to be that she 
seemed to have broken adrift from her identity, from her 
tradition, from all her faiths and aspirations If this is what 
I am, she said, I have nothing to offer him 
A man with astrachan flaps over his ears and a woman 
deeply wrapped in white fur turned their eyes on her as 
they passed through the hall — looking out of their own 
world as one looks out of a warm, closed carriage at a figure 
on the pavement edge 

“Ready?” said Uncle Pieter, standing before her with a 
pair of sealskin gloves tucked under his arm 

They drove out to a great dinner-party, given by the 
banker Penmnck, whose wife, not his wealth, entitled him 
to ask van Leydens to his table She was a second cousin 
of the Baron’s dead wife and had been well widowed 
m Bavaria before descending to the Penmnck establish- 
ment A strange mingling of briskness and languor, Julie 
thought, looking into the hard, black eyes and hearing the 
mild voice that seemed incapable of expressing anything 
but charming indecision “It’s hard not to go there when 
they know one is m the Hague,” Uncle Pieter had said 
“But Lien is a dangerous fool, always pecking at politics 
Don’t believe anything she says ” 

After dinner, Julie was led by her hostess towards a sofa 



220 


THE FOUNTAIN 


m 


set back m a recess beside one of the drawing-room fire- 
places, where no fire was burning 
“This is the Ruysdael we were talking of at dinner,” she 
said, and when Julie had admired the picture and would 
have joined the ladies gathered round a fire some ten yards 
away, she found herself detained “Let us sit here for a 
little while,” Mevrouw Penmnck said, “the room is warm,” 
and she would not move until, when the men entered, an 
elderly German, with heavy veins m his cheeks and a collar 
that thrust little loops of flesh forward from his jowl, 
crossed the room and, halting before her, said 
“Ah 1 the Ruysdael What an artist 1 He had everything 
except the vibratory quality of light ” 

Julie could not escape when Mevrouw Penmnck yielded 
her place to him He began at once to speak m praise of 
Narwitz, then m a low, intimate voice, of the blockade and 
its effect on Holland, of Enkendaal, of the English officers 
who, he had heard, were living there, of the wonderful in- 
fluence that the Germans and English might have had on 
the world if they had been allies, not enemies The pity of 
it ! The English and the French were not natural allies 
From that he passed easily to the inconveniences of war 
“A lady of fashion,” he said, “who is accustomed to have 
her dresses made m Pans and has also a tailor in London — 
now, if I may ask, that dress is from Pans?” 

“From the Hague ” 

“You do not go to Pans?” 

“How can I? My nationality is German ” 

“Nor to London^” 

“Of course not ” 

“I should have supposed that with your English blood 
that was a thing — not impossible ” 

His tone was not to be mistaken He was inviting her to 
become a German agent The elaborate ingenuousness of 
the manoeuvre amused her and she turned her head away to 

conceal a smile Might she not lead him on and then 

Speaking very softly, she replied “Perhaps impossible— 
certainly costly ” 

His fingers closed on the sofa-edge and he propelled

himself cautiously forward, seeking her face The eager- 
ness of a fat man seated is expressed m the angle between 
his belly and his knees 

“But means would be provided,” he said 

“By my husband?” 

A nicker of hesitation “Yes,” he answered, and she 
knew that he was smiling over her subtlety and his swift 
appreciation of it “By your husband — if you choose ” 

Then, from enjoyment of her game, she was drawn into 
fear To lead him on further might be to learn more than 
it was safe to know Already, she thought, I have gone too 
far and cannot withdraw without making a fool of him 
She imagined herself saying with unswerving solemnity, 
with mock indignation “Are you tempting me to play the 
spy m the country of my birth?” and the phrase repeated 
itself in her mind until she seemed to be hearing it spoken 
again and again m some ridiculous melodrama of Wonder- 
land Her shoulders began to shake and would not be 
stilled 

“You laugh?” he exclaimed “I had supposed for a 
moment that you were crying But you laugh?” 

“Oh,” she cried, “you have misunderstood me 1 When 

I said ‘certainly costly’ — I didn’t, I wasn’t thinking of ,” 

and she began to laugh, silently but immoderately, with 
laughter that racked her body and sickened her Looking 
mto his face, she was seized by a new and deeper paroxysm 
of laughter The white satin stretched across her knees 
shook and glinted, the pattern of the rug and the toe of 
her shoe upon it became a leaping fantastication, the lace 
handkerchief screwed between her fingers assumed the 
shape of a small pig wearing a vast, frilled night-cap To 
one fragment of clear knowledge she held fast that none 
must observe her, that she must be silent, that, m all the 
convulsions of laughter which was laughter no more, her 
lips must not be opened At last, controlled, she looked up 
at the man who was standing beside her, gravely observant 
Her eyes were brimming 

“I beg your pardon,” she said “What can you think of 
me?”

“That you are overwrought, Madame ” 

“Yes ” 

“And not only by what I ventured to say to you 
A parting of her lips, a quick movement of her breast, 
told him that his aim had been true He could not resist 
saying — and watching for the effect m her — “We all pray 
that Narwitz may be safely returned to you ” 

“Thank you ” 

He bowed, and left her to examine the Ruysdael While 
she gazed at the sombre canvas, seeing nothing but its 
darkness and a cloudy image of her own face, she thought 
how loosely adrift she was, how contemptibly alone, m a 
world where even a fool could so far misjudge her She 
was without root or clan, unrecognizable, belonging no- 
where — without existence, she added suddenly She was 
the wife of a man in whose reality she found it impossible, 
at that moment, to believe, and when she suddenly re- 
membered having felt the pressure of his hands and fore- 
arms on her naked back she shuddered, feeling that this 
was not a recollection of her own experience but of the 
experience of another woman who was dead He would 
not return to her, she knew, as if the scene were reflected 
for her in the Ruysdael, that Rupert’s body was lying now 
partly buried by earth, she saw the back of his head pro- 
truding and the heel of a riding boot She imagined herself 
running to his side and kneeling on the loose earth, his 
head turned, his eyes stared at her “Rupert*” she said, 
but he didn’t hear her, didn’t know of her existence, and, 
when he had faded from her sight, she saw, where his head 
had been, the face of the hotel-porter, who was saying 
“Von Narwitz Von Narwitz No, there has been no 
message, Mevrouw ” 

“You will play bridge?” Mevrouw Penmnck was saying 
Long afterwards, lying m bed, Julie was awakened, 
whenever she was about to fall asleep, by the same voice 
asking if she would play bridge, and m her mind she began 
to tap the glossy cards with her fingernail She had not 
asked for a message as she passed through the hotel on her 
way to her bedroom, and in the morning there were no

letters on her breakfast tray Uncle Pieter knocked on her 
door when she was partly dressed Covering herself, she 
admitted him There was, he said, a tram for Rynwyk at 
4 17, their guests at luncheon would be gone soon after 

three, if she would have her packing done 

“It shall all be done this morning,” she answered 
He looked at her shrewdly, then, picking up a fold of a 
dress that lay on her bed, asked 

“You are wearing this to-day — this blue thing?” 

“Yes Why?” 

“What colour is it?” 

“But — blue, Unde Pieter ” 

“I mean — the name of the colour, the dressmaker’s 
name ” 

“Why, powder blue ” 

“What shall you wear with it? What jewels?” 

“None, I expect Or perhaps my pearls ” 

“If you are nearly dressed and could come out with 
me — my appointment is in forty minutes — we could get 
a piece of sapphire — if you care for sapphires ” 

As a peasant buys live-stock, with knowledge, caution, 
a twinkling humour, he bought sapphires, leaning on his 
elbows across the jeweller’s glass show-case, allowing the 
brooch on which his choice fell to slide from palm to 
palm 

“For the end of an elopement,” he said “It pleases 
you?” 

“Uncle Pieter,” she said, “it’s lovely,” and kissed him 
“But it makes you happy?” 

“It’s lovely,” she repeated 

“Good,” he said doubtfully, and drove away to his 
appointment, leaving her on the jeweller’s doorstep with 
a little packet clutched in her hand 

Dark clouds, that clung together in stubborn wisps, 
were being dragged apart, and a pale, silvery sunshine 
touched the house-tops and floated down into the street 
“The vibratory quality of light 1 ” Her grotesque beguiler 
had known his Ruysdael, Ruysdael could not have painted 
this scene — the weak flash of enamelled motor-cars, the

low, silky gleam of shop windows, the fine, diamond dust 
that seemed to be rising from the snow and dancing m the 
air Monet might have painted it if he had been persuaded 
to forsake his open country, but even Monet could not 
have communicated the glitter in the air, he would have 
made one glitter of it, and have missed the fibrous quality 
that gave it an appearance of being composed of innumer- 
able sparkling filaments, swayed and shaken by the light 
She opened the case that contained her sapphires, think- 
ing that they would have a rare beauty now, but they were 
embedded m satin and shaded She took them out and 
placed them, at the base of the jeweller’s window, on a 
ridge of snow accumulated on the sill The snow was soft 
and loose They sank into it, but, through the powdery 
walls of their little prison, beams of light penetrated, 
awaking, m the depths of the blue, greenish fires With a 
gloved finger, Julie pressed the snowy walls inward until the 
sapphires were covered “And now,” she thought, “there 

is nothing to do but dig them out again, and then ” 

She took off her glove and thrust a bare, tingling finger- 
tip into the snow 

Where now? The joy she had had m tasting the air was 
gone out of her, Monet and Ruysdael were dead, the 
clouds were drawing together, her finger-tip dully ached 
At her own dressmaker’s no material would please her, 
she could think only that beautiful dresses, like silvery air 
and sapphires embedded in snow, were the pleasures of 
happiness All pleasures are, I suppose, she said There’s 
no pleasure on earth that wouldn’t be torment now 
There’s nothing I want There’s nothing I want ever, un- 
less And she saw herself sitting opposite Uncle Pieter 

m the 4 17, and sitting beside him in the car that would 
take them from Rynwyk to the Castle “Well, dear Juke,” 
her mother would say, “did you enjoy yourself at the 
Hague?” To-morrow mormng she would awake m the 
tower and look out over the lakes Fool* Tawdry, 
empty fool* All books, all pictures, all nature, all life — 
was the heart gnawed out of them all? She would go back 
to the hotel and read First she would ask at the porter’s

desk — but she would not dare to ask, and to postpone her 
humiliation she entered a shop and said that she wanted 
an evening dress The mannequins were sent for, dress 
after dress was brought out, she refused them all, then 
chose suddenly She tried on the dress she had chosen 
It was pretty with a diffuse prettiness that she hated, but 
the run of the satin under her hands momentarily soothed 
and delighted her She paid six hundred gulden into a 
padded hand “ Von Narwitz No, not van Narwitz 
Are you not Dutch yourself? Did you ever hear of a 
Narwitz in Holland?” 

“ Pardon, Mevrouw Mevrowo is Duitsch ?” 

She drove back to the hotel and left her sapphires The 
greater part of the morning lay before her She looked at 
the clock behind the porter’s head Perhaps, she thought, 
if I went to the Mauntshuis and looked at pictures, I 
should forget that there are clocks , but the idea of going 
to the gallery did not tempt her, and she was about to 
abandon the project when a superstition possessed her 
that, if she went to the Mauntshuis, Lewis would find 
her there She would look up from a picture to find him 
at her side, and she said to the porter “If anyone should 
ask for me, say that I shall be at the Mauntshuis until 
noon ” 

He bowed and smiled, a distrustful, tolerant smile, but 
she did not now observe it Her superstition had become 
an assurance, she knew that Lewis would find her, within 
an hour, her waiting would have ended, she was eager to 
be gone, the desire for decisive action hung upon her 
And it was m a mood of elation, which she would not 
permit her judgement to examine, that she entered the 
gallery There she hesitated It was clear in her mind that 
the picture she wished to see was Bellini’s “Agony in the 
Garden ” She longed to walk past the sleeping apostles 
and the figure of Jesus kneeling on its little mound, into 
that unearthly landscape, and lose herself in it On her way 
to the gallery, it was this picture that had hung m her 
sight, and now she remembered that it was in London, 
not m the Hague There’s nothing else, she thought, her

hands fell to her sides, she stood, checked, as though a 
door had been slammed m her face 
Then she went forward and sat down before “Adam and 
Eve m Paradise ” Her eyes sparkled as they moved with 
delight from the golden flesh of Rubens's figures to the 
gracious, smiling countryside that Brueghel had painted, 
wherein a lion, with grave scepticism, watched the kittenish 
gambols of leopard and tiger, and all the bright birds, the 
macaw, the peacock, were showing off their plumage, and 
the fish, perhaps startled by the yapping puppies at the 
brink of their stream and plainly determined to be m the 
picture, were conveniently displaying themselves in water 
so shallow that it concealed not a scale, not the edge of a 
fin Even the owls had kept awake and the tortoise, careless 
of the guinea-pigs near by, was making what haste he 
could into the foreground among the flowers, but not so 
close to the flowers as to mask one of their petals or permit 
them to hide the pattern of his shell Only the cats, into 
whose natures Brueghel must have had a critical insight, 
remained aloof, one sleeping comfortably on the branch of 
a tree while another, with happy indifference to the desti- 
nies of mankind, was rubbing his head against Eve's bare 
ankle while she gave Adam the apple 
Julie smiled at the friendly picture, and, when she had 
been seated a little while, she thought What brought me 
to this when the Bellini was m my mind? I came here with- 
out intention and here I am — and how happy! Suddenly, 
how ridiculously happy among the fawns and the elephants 
and the swans 1 There was never a moment m which I said 
I will look at my Brueghel again, but I came to it instantly, 
and she began to ask herself what was the nature of the 
remembered delight that had compelled her to this pic- 
ture without her having knowingly chosen her way But 
she was tired in spirit, and soon was glad to accept 
her pleasure without pursuing the reason of it, and so 
was refreshed It was long now since she had given rest 
to her mind’s arguments Day and night she had been 
troubled by her actions and the causes of them, which 
seemed to be working a transformation m herself, for

she was still very young, and, believing proudly that her 
actions were dependent on reason for which she alone was 
responsible, was not aware how often she must be changed 
before she was fit to die She had not yet that escape into 
humility which, m return for many hopes proved to be 
vain and m confirmation of different hopes fulfilled, the 
years gently and nobly give 

Velvet Brueghel’s picture opened a different way of 
escape to her, for, though she might admire other pictures 
with more eager curiosity, she loved none so well as this, 
and works of art that men love are a cloister where they 
may have absolute retirement and a cooling of their fevers 
m this world 

Every man, who is not a devil, has his own retreat, his 
intact island, ringed about with the waters of the spirit, 
where he may live his own life and not be pursued, and 
from which he may set out on his own voyages A saint 
vanishes thither continually, he walks upon the waters, 
the hounds check, and lose him, while they are sniffing 
the earth, he is gone The simple have an island in their 
simplicity, children, whom our blind knowledge seeks to 
encompass, m the starry jungle of their imagination, and 
some find refuge m the natural miracles, m their secret 
woods and mountains, to which they flee, not to praise 
beauty that is of the eye, but to reaffirm a fealty of the 
soul, obeying joyfully m the midst of life that maternal 
summons of dust to dust which, like death’s compassionate 
trumpet, is a supreme release from all claims These 
sanctuaries of art and nature, these profound and vital 
illusions which, like the illusion of death itself, are pre- 
ludes to rebirth, are necessary to them that have not the 
gift of holiness, for in these also there is confession with- 
out confessor and an engagement of the spirit with no 
arrogance m victory 

In every great work of art, Julie thought, an artist dies 
and rises again, and we, who enter into its illusion, die 
to this world and are reborn Considering the work 
before her, she was aware of being received into it, as 
if, walking beyond the apple-tree and the coiled serpent

into the enchanted glade where since her childhood a 
white horse had been waiting for her to ride away, she 
left her former self behind, asleep on the outskirts of the 
Garden 

And even when she remembered m how deep a per- 
suasion of Lewis’s approach she had entered the gallery, 
and understood that he would not come, even when it 
became clear that her assurance was delusion, a happy 
delusion as her imagining of Rupert’s death had been 
unhappy, she was at peace, thinking Perhaps this stillness 
which comes to me m the companionship of Brueghel is 
of the same nature with the stillness within the world that 
Lewis is seeking, and I am nearer to him now than I have 
ever been Perhaps there is m me, after all, a little 
of what he dreams of and imagines in me When I read 
his letters again I shall not be a stranger to them or be 
ashamed 

She returned to her hotel, put on the blue dress and the 
piece of sapphire Uncle Pieter had given her, and sat on 
a low stool beside her bedroom fire Across her bed was 
lying the dress she had bought earlier m the morning On 
entering the room, she had taken it out of the cardboard 
box m which it had been delivered, and, shaking out its

It doesn’t belong to me, she said, it has nothing to do 
with me 

She rang the bell and the chambermaid answered it — 
a timid German girl with clumsy feet and hands, but with 
the slow gait and simple stance of a countrywoman, and a 
startled innocence of expression Julie asked her now, m 
her own language, if she were German 
u Ja y Frau Grafin ” 

“From Prussia?” 

“J<2, Frau Grafin ” 

“I also ” 

The girl’s eyes brightened, then grew dull “But your 
ladyship is Dutch, not German,” she said 
“I was not born German But my husband is Prussian ” 
“Prussia is a long way off,” the girl said slowly, and

Julie, who had been about to question her further, was 
checked by her sadness and the privacy of her eyes 
“I rang for you to take away that dress ” 

“To take it away, my lady?” 

“You may have it, if it is of any use to you ” 

“But it is new, it is quite new, my lady ” 

“But you may have it ” 

The girl touched the satm with the fingers of one hand, 
then thrust an arm under the folds She was staring at the 
dress with the delight of a child m some marvellous, use- 
less inexplicable bright gift on a Christmas tree 
“For me, my ladv? For me? But I could never wear it ” 
“Nor I,” Julie said 

The girl spoke no more She forgot even to utter her 
thanks When she had lifted the dress and laid it down, 
lifted it again and turned it and stroked and patted it, she 
discovered with a wild glance that she was in Julie's room 
She began to apologize m breathless confusion, then, 
unable to continue, looked towards the door, as though 
measuring her distance from it, and, her cheeks white, her 
eyes burning, threw the dress over her arm and went 
out 

I suppose she will keep it m a trunk, Julie thought, and 
sometimes take it out and stare at it She will not sell it, 
that was not m her mind 

Lewis's letters were in a dispatch case at the bedside 
Julie took them out and seated herself by the fire again, 
holding them m her hand Presently she would read them, 
but for a little while was content to enjoy her quieted 
mmd, a fever seeming to have gone out of her, and when 
she began to read one of the letters, the muffled chime of a 
clock on the mantelpiece told her that the time had come 
for her to go downstairs to receive Uncle Pieter's guests 
In her handbag was a list, in his handwriting, of their 
names, known or unknown to her, with brief notes of 
their relationships, their callings, even of their marked 
prejudices “You must remember that he was very ill in 
the summer,” Uncle Pieter had said “His health is his 
only importance And she has a nephew fighting with

the French She is proud of that — but she is extremely 
neutral And this one has been twice married, but she 
is still a bride, she will always be a bride until she is a 
widow, and then soon she will be a bride again You cannot 
decently speak of her children, one of them has a beard 
and has made her a grandmother ” 

Julie impressed the list on her memory and walked 
across her room towards the door A bare room, she per- 
ceived suddenly, and stopped The packing of her luggage 
was almost completed, and, seeing the straps and labels, 
the froth of tissue paper, the emptiness of her open ward- 
robe in which hung only her furs, she remembered m what 
a bliss of expectation she had entered this room three days 
ago In the Hague she would see Lewis again, she had 
thought, and the room itself had been illumined by her 
joy There had been m all inanimate things — the curling of 
the straps, the bright colour of the labels, the ridiculous 
rabbits and acanthus foliage that were the pattern of the 
window-curtains — the same absurd and lovable aspect of 
adventurousness which had become visible to her in like 
objects on days of holiday during her childhood Now the 
same labels, the same straps, the same tissue paper were 
before her The holiday is over, she said, and a phase of 
my life is over As long as I live I shall dread hotels I 
have grown old in this room and she allowed her ejes to 
rest upon it with the curious, baffled, half-ironic melan- 
choly of one who gazes at the tomb m which he knows he 
will be buried Seventy-two, she thought as she went down- 
stairs, I shall remember the number 

In the hall she found it amusing to recognize her guests, 
before their names were spoken, by the list Uncle Pieter 
had given her, and to test their foibles m her conversation 

*T hope you are now quite well after your illness last 
summer?” 

“Quite welP Ah, perhaps that is too much to ask But 
better— mercifully better Do you know, there was a time 
when the doctors ”

father! Did he give it to you only this morning? Your birth-

day, perhaps May I look at it? Ah, no — do not trouble 
to take it off” 

But observing the pride in Uncle Pieter’s eye, Julie un- 
pinned the brooch and held it out How different it had 
looked in its bed of snow’ How mad she must have been 
to put it there’ Now it was being held up for admiration, 
the centre of a cluster of polished finger-nails, from which 
Julie raised her eyes to see her stepfather, with white cuff 
edging the sleeve of his outsti etched arm, move forward 
to take Lewis’s hand 

“But Alison, what a chance! You m the Hague’ Unfor- 
tunately we’re just leaving But you must lunch with us ” 

“Leaving?” Lewis said 

“And here’s Julie You haven’t forgotten her?” 

Her hand was in his 

“Are you leaving?” he said “Not to-day? Not now?” 

She moved her lips, touched them with her tongue 

“Thank you,” said the woman with the sapphires “Shall 
I pin it on for you — there’” 

“Shall we go m to lunch?” Uncle Pieter had taken 
Lewis’s arm and was leading him away “Come, Alison, 
we must find a place for you,” and, as they were moving 
towards the dining-room, he added “Why not come up to 
Enkendaal with us? The cottage is full, I know Stay in the 
Castle, then Is that possible? Stay until Dirk’s papers are 
finished ” 

“You may be inviting me for years,” Lewis answered 

“Well, so much the better You’ll earn your keep 
Isn’t that a good idea, Julie?” 

She saw Lewis’s eyes on hers, and answered “Yes 
yes” — the repetition being a scarcely spoken secret of her 
breath, for she seemed to be consenting to a miracle, the 
word raised her from the dead She was giddy under the 
impact of life and she thought How shall this body die 
and these limbs be cold beyond the sun? And because the 
idea of death was to her then but a sheet of transparent 
glass, holding no image of herself, she saw her body in her 
grave as a child sees, through the window of a doll’s house, 
a doll lying m its bed She saw herself lying with open

eyes, gazing upward through the turf, and smiled as though 
she were playing a game, so enchanting to her senses was 
it to imagine herself dead and to feel the currents of desire 
within her 

The group in which she moved had drifted on towards 
the dining-room When Uncle Pieter asked her what was 
the number of her room, that he might order their luggage 
to be brought down, she answered “ Sixty, I think Or 

sixty-two,” and it was the page-boy who corrected her 
She was wondering what she might say to Lewis in the 
hearing of others, and while the party was gathering at the 
table she did not look at him 
Two guests separated her place from his, at last she 
spoke across them 

“What made you come to the Hague to-day, Lewis*” 
“But what makes you leave to-day*” he replied 
“Uncle Pieter’s appointment was for this morning 
There’s nothing else to stay for ” 

“But don’t you generally stay a few days if you come 
to the Hague at all?” 

“We have been here since Wednesday ” 

“Since Wednesday!” he exclaimed “Then ” 

The woman on his farther side interrupted him Some- 
times, out of the babble of conversation, his voice came 
to Julie He was talking of the severity of the winter, of 
Groenlingen, of reading at Leiden, and she herself was 
listening to the old gentleman on her right who warned her 
that, m modern conditions of warfare, Holland’s power to 
flood her countryside might not prove to be as effective a 
barrier against invasion as it had been in the past 
“No,” she said, “I suppose there are all sorts of con- 
trivances now for overcoming the difficulty of ” 

“Yes,” the old gentleman answered “In the first 
place ” 

After luncheon, Julie was thinking, shall we have a 
chance to talk together? He must have supposed that 
Friday was the day of our arrival m the Hague, not of our 

leaving it Did I m my letter

snow,” said the young man on her left, a Swede with wide, 
dark eyes set surprisingly m a blond face, and she began 
to discuss with him winter-sports m Holland, m Sweden, 
m Switzerland 

“After the war,” he said, “you must come to Sweden 
It would please you, I am sure There is something that 
would delight you at every season of the year In the spring, 
for example ” 

“I should like to make my first visit in the spring,” she 
answered, thinking that, when they rose from the table, 
Lewis would be detained among the men and that when 
he came into the hall she would be already surrounded 
But she was untroubled by the thought, untroubled by the 
crowd, the chatter, the necessity to divide her attention 
between the military defence of Holland and the Swedish 
spring Her companionship with Lewis was not affected 
by interruption Seeing his hand laid on the table, she felt 
that her own was beneath his fingers' touch To the world 
she was sleeping, withdrawn into imperturbable com- 
posure, speaking and laughing and listening m a dream, 
in herself and m him, she was awake

CHAPTER ONE 

To-night he will come to me, Julie said Standing before 
her mirror with arms raised, loosening her hair, she became 
still, gazing first at the receding images of the room behind 
the girl whose face she saw, then at the face itself, its 
unfamiliar flush and whiteness, its sparkling, fascinated 
terror She did not know herself in this girl whose face 
made her think of lilies and diamonds But suddenly she 
recognized the eyes, they were familiar, there was a shaft 
of her childhood m them, and she thought It is I, who 
wondered so often what would become of me It is I, who, 
when I was lonely here, hugged my sides with my elbows 
to give me courage, and set my mouth and dreamed 
dreams She set her mouth again, seeking to recover the 
virginal determination of that remembered child, but her 
kps would not assume the old shape She could but smile 
at her failure, a smile, she thought, of farewell 
The instant was gone and the face that had touched it 
with magic, though she looked for ever into her mirror, 
she would never see that face again Hair fell over her 
shoulders, and what she saw now was the inclination of 
her body, the nse and fall of her arm, white against the 
tapestry of the bed, and a gleam from her moving brush 
How deep, how silent the room was! She turned abruptly 
from her dressing-table to face the shadows that had been 
stooping over her How silent { And soon his voice would 
be in it and hers answering him She spoke his name aloud, 
but softly “Lewis 1 ” and spoke it again Thus she had 
spoken it when he was gone away and she seemed to have 
lost him Often, then, she had fallen asleep with the

whisper of his name on her lips and his absence aching 
m her body And to-night, she thought, before I fall 
asleep at last, I will speak his name, saying to myself, 
He is not here 1 and shall stretch out my hand and find 
him 

And some night, after a few months, a few weeks— who 
knows how soon? — I shall stretch out my hand m the 
darkness and not find him It will be ended, he will go his 
way and I shall go mine, m all our lives we shall not, as 
lovers, find each other again, but all our lives we shall feed 
on the hours and days that will begin — she looked towards 
the door by which he would enter, thinking she heard his 
step, but she had heard nothing, and while she completed 
her undressing her fingers were by turns hot and cold 
against her, and she would stand long motionless, now 
sad that her love held not even that delusion of the ever- 
lasting which is our little weapon against death, now in 
delight of that very impermanence which made of it, not 
an impossible loyalty to be fought for, not a youth that 
must grow old, but an immortal thing, as they that die 
young are immortal She was filled with lightness and 
exaltation, as though by some miracle she had been made 
exempt from the rule of life, from time, consequence 
and price, and the joy now approaching her were indeed 
magical and detached — scarcely her own joy, interwoven 
with the stuff of her existence, but the joy of a song or a 
play to which she was audience, and she began to think 
not of the actual winter but of the scented darkness of a 
summer’s night, not of the physical man that was to take 
her but of a being that was part of the fire m her own limbs, 
not even of herself as she was — a half-naked girl crouched 
by the fire — but of an illusion proceeding from within her as 
music proceeds from an instrument But no sooner did 
she begin to recognize this aerial independence of circum- 
stance as the illusion of love itself and to whisper in her 
mind, This is love, than the illusion was dissipated, fleeing 
as Eros fled before Psyche’s lamp, and she saw that she 
was naked, and was ashamed, and made haste to cover 
herself

To-night he would come, but not yet, not until the 
household had long been asleep 
The world and its fear and the stimulus of its fear being 
now upon her, she trembled Come soon, come soon, she 
said, and because to wait had become intolerable she 
imagined that she might kill expectation in sleep His 
touch would but half-awaken her, the reality of his coming 
would be cloaked in a dream But it would be impossible 
to sleep, she knew In the dark, as now m the candlelight, 
she would remember how this evening, when they had 
seemed before others to be saying good night, his eye&> 
had asked, and hers had answered, the question that for 
three days had hung between them, and the remembrance 
of this unspoken betrothal would pierce her and quicken 
her breath so that she could not sleep 
Now he was xn the library below her room, waiting 
until it was certain that none would visit him there Then 
he would open the door at the foot of the interior stair- 
case, and climb the narrow, broken steps, his shoulder 
guided by the curving wall He would knock on her door 
and she open it 

She lifted away the leather screen that stood across the 
door and slid back the bolt Should she go down to him? But 
she turned away, drew a fur gown closely about her, 
renewed the fire with peat and fragrant wood, then, 
mounting the low dais set in an embrasure, drew her feet 
under her on to the window-seat When he knocked, she 
would not move When he entered and spoke, perhaps 
she would not answer He would suppose the room to be 
empty, his eyes would search it with surprise and alarm, 
then he would see her, and his exclamation ease their 
encounter, breaking the silence between them 
She drew the curtains apart, but there was no moon, 
no glint on the waters nor nft on the heavy sky When she 
opened a pane and would have leaned out, January drove 
her back, but after the window was closed again, the curl 
and hiss of the waterfall persisted in her hearing, or m 
her imagination, and a thm, lisping breeze flicked at the 
outer stones like the run of a lizard Come soon, she said,

pressing her clasped hands upon her knees Let him come 
soon, she repeated, laying her fingers on her hot cheeks 
and rising from her place as though to welcome him The 
future may take care of itself— and with a gesture of her 
hand she thought that she put it from her Grant that I 
may not be mean and fearful, give me a single mind for 
this love that will not come again Encircle it Guard it 
Enclose me in it And covering her face, she supposed 
that she was enclosed from the world But I am praying, 
she thought, and, surprised that she had been praying, 
sank down on her knees, there being for her an ancient 
comfort of familiarity m the attitude of prayer But 
criticism of herself had driven prayer from her mind, and 
she could say only, without thought of their relevance, 
words taught to her long ago, which by their rhythm and 
association, not by their meaning, so commanded her 
that, when they had been silently spoken and repeated, 
she remained upon her knees, hearing the waterfall and 
the low wind as though they were of a world that she 
would never revisit 

When Lewis knocked on the door at the head of the 
wall staircase and received no answer, he thought that 
she was perhaps afraid to answer, and entered She was 
m the window-seat, her face turned towards the blank 
night beyond the panes, and seemed not to have heard 
him Even when he had taken her hand in his and she had 
spoken his name, there was for a moment a wandering 
look m her eyes, as though she doubted what they saw 
Her breathing was long and deep, when she was in his 
arms, her body was tremulous, like a tree that is not visibly 
moved but responds to the wind with gentle, continuous 
vibrations 

“Julie,” he said 

Her head, which she had turned away, was lifted to him 
again and, though her lips did not move, he received an 
impression of her smiling, of gladness, finality, rest 

“It isn't true — ” she began, trying to smile “It was all 
to have been for an instant of our lives only That's what 



CH I 


THE TOWER 


241 

we said But it isn’t true ” Her voice failed her and she 
pressed her face into hiding 

“Julie,” he repeated “Julie ” and he too became 

silent, possessed by a happiness so great, and so different 
from any happiness that he had before experienced or 
imagined, even m his thoughts of her, that there seemed 
to be a spirit crying within him I am born! I am alive' I 
have come out of the darkness' He sat down in the window- 
seat and she beside him, feeling that all other existences 
had been laid to rest, that they only were waking, that they 
were by some miraculous influence set a little apart from 
the natural world, and were watching it as they might 
watch a child that, having been m pam, was fallen asleep 
Her fingers tightened on his She raised her eyes, wide 
and shimng with tears They were filled with supplication 
and surrender, not to him personally, but to the new life 
in her that he represented, and, as she saw him, not as 
man only, but as a frail symbol, which is all man can be, 
of powers on whose surface his life is tossed, compassion 
flowed into her love She seemed at once to be pitying and 
beseeching pity She was his refuge and the being whose 
only refuge was m him A flame passed through him, his 
body became a single pulse, leaping from strength to 
strength, and suddenly, lifting her hand, he pressed his 
lips to it Over him she sighed, as though all life had been 
given into her keeping, and he felt her fingers move upon 
his hair He lifted his head and gazed long into her face, 
silently and with growing comprehension of the change 
m her, m himself, m the destiny and significance of their 
love for each other How radiant her face was' How lighted 
with tenderness and acceptance and awe! The fear and 
hunger, the wild, troubled fierceness that he had once 
seen in it, were vanished Desire remained without the 
terror and anger of desire Delight shone there, but with 
a clear, tranquil brilliance He sprang to his feet, drawing 
her towards rum by both her hands, and so easily did she 
follow that her hair was lifted from her shoulders by the 
swiftness of her movement 



CHAPTER TWO 

“What have you been doing all day?” van Leyden asked 
each evening as he sat down to dinner, a question seldom 
answered It was no more than a formal indication that he 
was done with the work of his estate and had become a 
social being, he did not expect a reply If Sophie said she 
had been into Rynwyk or his wife that she had been pay- 
ing calls, he lifted his eyebrows to suggest that he was 
interested, and continued to drink his soup in peasant- 
fashion, his fingers wrapped round his little bowl If they 
spoke of his tenants, or of the war in its relation to them, 
he became animated at once and allowed his soup to be- 
come cold while he talked, but nothing else roused him 
until, after dinner, his cigar was alight Then he could be 
gay and shrewd, and his eyes, emerging from his wrinkles 
like a bird’s, shine with delight as he twitted Sopbie or 
led Julie on to talk of vanities 

It was his habit to pretend that young and pretty women 
could be interested in nothing but adornments and pleasure- 
seeking — unless it were in money, considered as a means 
to these feminine ends When they were married and old, 
he spoke to them of solider things — of rank, of marriage- 
makmg, of family affairs, often of the past when they also 
had been young But married or single, they were women 
Conversation with them must never be deeply serious 
Business was barred, politics, except its polite super- 
ficiality, was barred, all gambling, all aspects of love except 
a flirtation or a matrimonial alliance, all profound grief 
or hope, all genuine insight into their minds — these were 
to be avoided or cloaked in raillery You did not give your-

self away to a woman — not more than once in a lifetime 
If her eyes shone and you guessed the reason, you made 
no use of your knowledge, there was pleasure enough in 
silent possession of it If there were tears in her eyes, you 
rustled a newspaper or looked out of the window, and a 
few days afterwards gave her sapphires — some trinket 
Nice things, women, too nice — or devilish, but gentle or 
cruel, if you gave them a chance they twined themselves 
Like ivy on a tree trunk, like serpents, he would think 
sometimes, like children at play, irresistible, gripping your 
knees 

Julie understood now, as she had never understood 
before, that her stepfather’s elaborate manners — his 
geniality and his sudden, forbidding coldness, his little 
jokes, unexpected gifts, and shaped courtesies — were 
self-protective Why, she had often wondered, had he 
withdrawn into impenetrable silences when she, a child, 
aching to spend her affection on someone who would 
respond to it, had gone into his room and curled herself 
up expectantly in his arm-chair? All her life she had been 
puzzled by this question, for she had known intuitively 
that he had not been wanting in tenderness towards her 
Now, in the first days of her love’s fulfilment, she per- 
ceived the reason Uncle Pieter’s life was laid open before 
her, and she said to him one evening after dinner 
“If I’d been a boy when I came here, should you have 
taught me how to run the estate?” 

“I suppose so, my dear ” 

“Though I didn’t belong?” 

“Why not?” 

“And you’d have taken me about with you and talked 
to me — seriously, as an equal?” 

He shifted in his chair, tried to ride away on a little 
joke 

“Ladies, you see, have to be treated with respect ” 
“No,” she said “Tell me, Uncle Pieter If I’d not been 

a girl, when we were in the Hague together ” 

“I shouldn’t have given you sapphires 1 ” He chuckled 
“It cuts both ways ”

*44 

“Ah,” she answered quickly, “that’s what I wanted to 
know,” and he looked up, puzzled, uneasy, feeling that he 
must have said more to this girl than he had intended to 
say “Bless you,” she added, touching his hand with hers 
“You’re a dear, Uncle Pieter ” 

He gripped her fingers “What is it you want now- 
more sapphires?” 

“No ” 

“I’d give them to you ” 

“Why?” 

“Don’t you want them?” 

“No ” 

“What then?” 

“Just to understand ” 

“Bah J You women are always making mysteries I can’t 
make head or tail of you ” 

“Yes, you can,” she answered “That’s why you’re a 
dear ” 

“Then do something to please me ” 

“Anything ” 

“Play on the piano Chopin ” 

But though he might escape into Chopin, she knew that 
she had discovered in him what had long been hidden from 
her, she saw him as an inhabitant of the world of new per- 
ceptions into which she had but lately entered Her mother, 
too, was changed, had ceased to be formidable, the biting 
affability peculiar to her, which had once had the effect on 
Julie of chafing harness on a horse of mettle, had no more 
influence now than the repetitive patter of a comedian Her 
hatred of her mother was a surprising memory of another 
existence, so indifferent to her had she become And Sophie 
— Sophie was a suspicious ghost, embittered, pitiable, 
powerless It’s odd, Julie thought, if Sophie could prove 
what she suspects, or is beginning to suspect, she could 
rum me, and would Yet I am no more afraid of her than 
I should be if she were blind and deaf and dumb 

Having come from the piano, she listened idly to Sophie’s 
observations on the winter — that it was good because it 
was Dutch, so different from the clammy bitterness of an

English January Soon Lewis would rise and say good 
night 

“Shall you be working late?” her mother would say 

Meanwhile he sat among them, his hands, which in the 
past had been restless, lying still on the arms of his chair, his 
dark eyes lively but at peace She remembered having read 
the complaint of some lover — a poet? a philosopher? she 
could not recall the form of the saying — that the agony of 
lovers was their powerlessness to surmount the barrier of 
individuality Even in love, the writer had said, there is no 
escape from the eternal solitude of oneself We kiss but 
cannot mingle We clasp each other but come no nearer 
We would be one but remain two always When man and 
woman lie together m the last ecstasy of passion, making 
the utmost endeavour of the flesh to pass beyond the 
division of their souls, they mock themselves, though they 
endow the act of love with every power of imagination, 
with romance, poetry and religion, though they identify it, 
m the begetting and the love of children, with their aspira- 
tion towards immortality itself, it remains the physical act 
of two divided and solitary beings, and they are mocked m 
it as two birds are mocked that seek each other through a 
pane of glass 

So she had read and until now had believed Often, 
during that long winter, walking alone through the frozen 
countryside or sitting in the library with Lewis or hearing 
his breathing when he had fallen asleep in her arms, she 
asked herself m vam how it was that the consequences of 
this belief, which reason still supported, were lifted from 
her — its consequences of fear and doubt and jealousy, the 
torments of love There was no answer but the plain one — 
that nothing was as it had been, that all earth was made 
anew 

The evidences of change were m her own pride Once 
she would have been jealous of Lewis’s solitude He would 
shut himself up in the library and come from it at last 
wrapt m thought that could not at once be shaken from 
him A haze of meditation was still upon his eves, and from 
it his seeing emerged slowly when he encountered her

“You had forgotten my existence 1 ” she said, and, when 
he turned to walk beside her, she added “Dearest, Vm 
glad it is possible,” and said it from her heart, for it ap 
peared to her as an endorsement of their love that his work 
had a new peace and continuity and that she could be alone 
for many hours without feeling shut out But of all her 
joys the greatest at this time was the discovery of tran 
quillity within passion itself The shadeless burning that 
had tormented her was transformed into the ardour of a 
benign summer, an ardour of which each quenching and 
renewal was as natural a miracle as nightfall and daybreak 
All the barbs had gone from desire, yet was desire itself 
continually deepened and enriched The impulse to resist, 
the humiliation of being compelled by her own hungers to 
surrender, the core of resentment m this delight, were gone, 
to hear Lewis’s approach by the tower-stair, to feel her 
pulses quicken and a current of expectancy leap from brain 
to limbs, to lose her breath when he uncovered her body, 
to be caught into a tumult of consciousness without thought 
when his silence was upon her, was now to her as un- 
stained with misgiving as the stretching out of a hand into 
the sun 

Because the earth and all men m it were revealing them- 
selves anew to her, and nothing seemed stale or used or 
firally accepted, but everything, however familiar, came 
to her with the offer of fresh secrets, Julie was visited by 
a sense of being at once very old and very young — very

day, to lose none of the sparkle of existence beneath the 

f rey mists of half-thought, very old m her having passed 
eyond a former life upon which she now looked back with 
simlmg curiosity, wondering how to identify herself with it 
“All men are children,” she had heard women say and 
had dismissed the phrase as a formula of sentimentality, 
but she understood now that there was a fascination, and 
a cause of love, in watching a man grow, m remarking the 
changes m him and his slow awakening to truths that she 
had already perceived It seemed strange to her, whose 
mind was retentive and logical, that Lewis should so often

appear to have forgotten, or have strayed away from, 
truths that he had long ago apprehended His work on 
Dirk’s manuscripts was steady and consistent, the patient 
investigation of them satisfied a need m him and, though 
he was baffled now and then by some historical allusion or 
roused to sudden excitement by a passage of uncommon 
humour or wisdom, his struggle with the crabbed writing 
was an equable one But sometimes he would turn from his 
own work on the seventeenth century with a laughing sigh 
of despair 

“Julie, I wonder if all this is wasted labour?” he said 
Do you remember the man in Ibsen’s Little Eyolf who was 
writing a fat volume on Human Responsibility First, he 
sacrificed everyone, his wife, his child, everyone, to the 
composition of his masterpiece, then, when he had at last 
discovered that the task was too big for him, he made 
excuses for abandoning it, and glorified his excuses and 
sacrificed everyone to them These great tasks that men 
set themselves are always penlous To go on with them 
may be hypocrisy and to abandon them another form of 
hypocnsy That is true m a way of any exceptional task, 
great or small, that we choose for ourselves ” 

“But, Lewis, dear,” she answered, “are you wanting to 
justify your choice to yourself or — to the world? You still 
wonder whether anyone will read your book when it’s 
done, whether it will be famous or not And yet, deep 
mside you, you care for applause less than any man I’ve 
ever known But part of you is a man of business and 
belongs to the world He’s still alive, isn’t he? Isn’t he?” 

Lewis acknowledged it “He writes to his mother or his 
sisters and to his partner every week,” he said with a 
smile “Do you know, Julie, sometimes when I’ve put 
those letters aside for an hour or two and have re-read 
them before closmg them down, they seem to have been 
written by someone who died long ago ” 

He was standing at his table m the library, running his 
hand over the books lying open there Julie put her arm m 
his and they began to walk up and down together m the 
shadows of the great room

“O Lewis,” she exclaimed “Ghosts* Ghosts* How you 
live with them* It’s that business man, the dead man, you 
want to please by producing a famous book So that you 
can say to him T told you it wasn’t just arrogance and a 
waste of time You see there was something m it after all * 
And if you did, what do you think he’d answer? He’d 
sneer and say *0 yes, the book is famous, but it’s miles 
away from the solid bread and butter of life ’ And he’d 
add 'How much good do you think it did to people? Are 
they going to be less hungry or warmer or have more 
leisure or more of any of the good things of life because 
you’ve written it?’ That’s all he’d say He wouldn’t be 
grateful or satisfied It’s no good trying to satisfy the 
ghosts of oneself, they’re insatiable And the odd thing 
is,” she added, “that you know it far better than I do 
Didn’t you tell me, long ago, that this book wasn’t an end 

m itself but a — a kind of ” 

“A discipline,” he said “1 know ” 

She glanced into his face “But you forget — as a child 
forgets its lesson ” 

“No, I don’t forget,” he answered “But some lesson 
farther on in the book suddenly attracts me, and I turn 
on, and then I lose my place You have helped me to find 
it again ” He laughed and drummed a knuckle on the 
snowy window “There’s no index That’s the devil of it ” 
“To what?” 

“To the inner life — the life of the spirit ” 

“Isn’t every religion an index?” 

“Is it ? Jesus and Plato may write the book, but they 
leave you to find your own way m it Their followers try 
to write the index Isn’t that why men accept the discipline 
of churches? You see, Julie,” he added, “I’m miles 
away from being a philosopher I talk and try to learn, 
but still in effect I’m a pupil who’s scarcely begun to find 
his way I thought I was so damned secure, and that little 
else mattered but the development of my own ideas And 
now — there’s you — like sunshme and wind after a stuffy 
room You teach me more than I should ever have learned 
from books ”

“What can I teach you?' 5 

“Not to mistake day-dreams for meditation — that’s one 
thing And to laugh at my solemn self — that’s another ” 
“That’s why I love you,” she said 
“Because you can teach me?” 

“Because you think I can ” 



CHAPTER THREE 

Week after week, the frost held The angles of the Castle 
were blunted and every undulation of the moor was 
flattened by snow, over the little village a thick covering 
was spread from which proceeded wreaths of smoke that 
seemed to be the issue of subterranean fires Vertical walls 
had the appearance of rents in the general whiteness and 
window-panes gleamed like ebony within their encrusted 
frames The eye, entranced by the mysterious deadness of 
the countryside, which seemed to lie under a spell, and by 
a reflected pallor within doors that gave to high noon the 
ghostly semblance of early morning, began to accept at 
last, as though it were everlasting, the bleak, neutral 
glitter of a shrouded sun At dusk, when the skaters were 
gone, birds swept down m hungry clusters to the edges 
of the lake, hoping that the villagers might have left 
food there, and soon, if there were to be stars, the first 
constellations appeared, not as serene jewels hung on the 
domed surface of the sky, but as fierce origins of light 
profoundly embedded m it, their rays piercing its blackness 
like needles of crystal 

So few were the changes m weather during those days 
that each change was memorable, and Lewis long re- 
membered an evening on which, while he was w alkin g 
home with Julie, the wind moved southward and clouds 
thickened m the sky — promising a thaw, she said 

“Perhaps the last of the snow,” he answered “There 
may be a sudden spring ” 

She paused to watch the sunset drive down the sky like 
a ship m flames The frozen floods in the distant valley,

which all the afternoon had been grey and dead, were now 
a running fire, the black, huddled pines m the foreground 
glowed and stood apart, divided by tawny gleam and 
shadow of sapphire, the snow of the moor, which had 
appeared to be of unvaried smoothness, exhibited to the 
flattening rays each billow of its surface, each roughness of 
its texture, but did not shme, the colours it received were 
dim and watered, as though seen through frosted glass 
“ It will freeze again when the wind shifts,” Julie said, 
“even if the frost breaks to-night ” And suddenly she 
exclaimed “I believe you are glad 1 ” 

And he answered, glancing at her with delight “I am* 
In winter, time stands still To-morrow is always the 
same as to-day as long as there’s snow on the ground I 
don’t want time to move ” 

“You are as happy as that?” 

“And you?” 

She nodded and walked on, drawing him with her 
“I know what you are thinking,” she said, “because I 
too am thinking it You are thinking what neither of us 
has dared to say — but it’s only folly, Lewis dear, to say it 
now ” 

“That there needn’t be any end for us?” 

“That we might have all our lives together, if we 
chose Let’s imagine, Lewis, that it’s true Everything 
we said and thought before we became lovers isn’t bind- 
ing on us any more — we’ve broken free of it, and of all 
the circumstances of our lives — let’s imagine that And 
imagine,” she added with a hardening of her voice, “that 
marriage with me wouldn’t rum you and make all the hope 
of your life impossible and that I am not married and 
pledged — even more important, that I’m not the kind or 
woman I am That’s the barrier between us, Lewis Not 
that you are poor and I — on other people’s money — rich, 
not that you are ten years older than I am or that I have a 
husband All that we could break down The barrier is 
that I am I and you are you — not made to live m the same 
world ” 

“Here we do,” he said 



THE FOUNTAIN

*S 2 

“Yes, in a kind of enchantment that shuts out your 
world and mine ” 

“But Julie,” he cried, “we love each other Something 
that is neither yours nor mine has arisen out of our love — 
something independent of us Aren’t we pledged to that? 

When I see you as you are now ” 

She took ms hand and pressed it 
“But this winter can’t last for ever, Lewis dear,” she 
said, looking away from him to the west where already 
the deeper colours were fading m the sky and great fleeces 
of cloud were drawn out into primrose shreds “Spring 
will come, and summer, then autumn and winter again 
Unless we ourselves are changed, we shall become mem- 
bers of separated worlds ” 

“Do you hear from Narwitz?” Lewis asked suddenly 
“Yes” 

“Itis on your mind? Julie, you aren’tunhappy or guilty 

or sad?” 

“Not guilty, or unhappy ” 

“But sad?” 

She did not answer at once “Sad, only because I love 
you as I didn’t know I should,” she said after considera- 
tion “I suppose, deep down in my mind, was the thought 
that if you were my lover I should become satisfied, and 

that, when the time came for us to part ” She raised 

her voice in defiance, not of him, but of herself “I wanted 
you, I suppose And now,” she added, “it seems intolerable 
to me that there should ever be a time when we shall not 
walk across snowy moors, scarcely speaking for hours, or 
sit in the library together, debating some line of Quarles 
or a passage from Fenelon or a fragment of the Timaeus ” 
Fenelon led them to Bossuet, Bossuet to Molmos, and 
from Molmos the way was easy to Inglesant and the 
seventeenth century m England, a subject of which they 
never grew weary Darkness had fallen when they entered 
the grounds of the Castle, but the clouds were drawn away 
to the north and stars were out The reflected glow of 
lighted wmdows seemed to be rising from within the snow 
“Stop for a moment and listen,” Lewis said 



CH III

253 

They stood m silence, hearing the wind flow among the 
branches of the avenue Julie’s face turned to his, she 
was about to speak, but, seeming to decide that what she 
had intended to say might not be spoken, she put her two 
furry gloves on to Lewis’s shoulder and hid her face m 
them until he, bending back her head, kissed her lips and 
her icy cheeks and her closed eyes She moved and clung 
to him 

“Don’t let me go,” she whispered “Never let me go ” 

“Never?” he said “Is that your promise, Julie? Your 
will?” 

Instantly she slackened m his arms and released herself 

“Yes,” she answered, “it is my will — 0 Lewis, it is all 
my being — in this enchanted garden ” 

Swiftly, at the word, as though it had in her ears a fatal 
sound, she touched him 

“Listen,” she said “Do you hear the voice of God 
among the trees?” 

He searched her face in the darkness, questioning the 
seriousness of her mood There was fear in her eyes but 
her lips were smiling 

“The last lines,” she said “Say them to me ” 

“My dearest — of what?” 

“Of the Milton Say them When we hear them again 
we shall remember ” 

Still he did not know of what she was speaking, and she 
began m a low voice 

“‘They looking back all th’ eastern side beheld of 
Paradise 

She could not continue The wind of the avenue was 
m her silence while she waited And Lewis said 

“They looking back all th’ eastern side beheld 
Of Paradise, so late their happy seat, 

Waved over by that flaming brand, the gate 
With dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms 
Some natural tears they dropped ” 

Her fingers tightened abruptly on his arm “Soon,” she 
said, “so soon for us } ” But in an instant she had thrown

her darkness from her “Now,” she exclaimed, “let’s go 
m Lights People This evening 111 come down to you m 
the library Shall I? Read to me All night we shall be 
together And to-morrow and to-morrow ” 

They went on, having forgotten the world In the hall 
they found Goof, Come, Allard and Sophie, with the 
Baron in their midst The Baroness came with Ballater 
out of the smoking-room Behind them Ramsdell’s face 
appeared 

“You’re late,” Goof said “We thought you were lost 
You know the news?” 

Allard rounded the phrase for it 
“The Russian Empire has fallen The Tsar has abdi- 
cated ” 

“Then Russia is out of the war?” 

There was an outbreak of confused comment “It may 
strengthen her,” one suggested “The new Government 
is pro-ally,” another exclaimed 
“But will the new Government last?” Ramsdell said 
“If you ask me,” Ballater put in, “it may bring the re- 
organization that Russia needs ” His smile was comforting 
but the disquiet of the group persisted 
“Change 1 Change*” van Leyden said “Even the 
Romanovs ” And he added incredulously “It will be the 
Hapsburgs next ” 

He clasped and unclasped his hands behind his back 
“At least,” he said, “England will save the Tsar and his 
family He is your King’s cousin There is no need that 
England should be too late this time There’s a breathing 
space ” 

Ballater cleared his throat “Don’t you think, sir, that 
perhaps you’re taking too gloomy a view? After all, the 
Tsar appears to be in no danger ” 

The old man flung out ms hands “No danger! No 
danger* When the wolves have him down* Ah,” he cried 
m exasperation, “that is the English all over You never 
recognize a revolution when you see one You always hope 
to convert a pack of wolves into a Liberal party and gener- 
ally, m your own country, you succeed But Russia is not 



ch in THE TOWER 255 

England You will be too late I see it You will be too 
late!” 

“What matters,” said Ballater, intending no more than a 
conciliatory diversion, “is that Russia, whoever rules her, 
shouldn’t make a separate peace ” 

The Baron stared at him “That’s English too,” he 
exclaimed “That is very English That is the reason of 

your greatness ” and Ballater, not understanding, 

smiled affably and shook his head 

Lewis and Julie observed the old man’s emotion without 
sharing it “The Russian Empire has fallen*” They had 
listened to the remote words and to the excited, nervous 
discussion that had followed, as though, two passers-by, 
they had overheard through an open window the exclama- 
tions of a group of strangers 



CHAPTER FOUR 


Once m each week the English officers went into Rynwyk 
to report at the office of the district commandant Ballater 
was often absent with his car, having leave to visit the 
Hague or stay with G overt van Leyden at the Huis ten 
Borgh, and Lewis and Ramsdell would then go into the 
town by the tramway that passed withm a mile of Enken- 
daal, returning on foot across country A new intimacy 
between them arose from these long, regular walks 

Saturday after Saturday at the same hour of the morning 
they came by the same way Sometimes they took up an 
argument where it had been left some days earlier More 
often, having received news of the war in Rynwyk, they 
would discuss it as they came through the prim outskirts 
of the town and be led on to speak of what might follow 
the compromise that both now believed to be inevitable 
Suspense? Disorganization? Another war? The tide of 
revolution would not stop at the Russian frontier all 
foundations were shaken — badly shaken m Germany, 
Ramsdell added 
“You believe that?” 

“Julie believes it ” 

“What reason has she?” 

“But hasn’t she told you,” Ramsdell asked, “of her 
husband’s letters?” 

Lewis answered that she had not, and a silence fell 
until Ramsdell, feeling that having said so much he must 
say more, continued “Though he never speaks of revolu- 
tion, he gives her news of their estates From words here 
and there about their servants, and local people, and a 

256

*57 


cousin of his who is a social democrat, she thmks — and is 
sure Narwitz thinks — that there are rocks ahead ” 

He had chosen colourless phrases, hoping that Lewis’s 
interest in the subject would fail, and Lewis pressed him 
no further for Julie’s confidence 

“She said nothing of it to me,” he repeated 

“Probably because she didn’t want to worry you with 
it?” 

“Worry me ? Was she genuinely worried?” 

Ramsdell hesitated “I think she was After all, her own 
future is tied up in it ” 

“Yes, I had almost forgotten that,” Lewis replied “It 
is easy to forget m this place that there is a future m which 
all of us, you and I — and Julie, will become different 
people, sailing off like paper boats on different streams 
Soon after we part, we shan’t be within hailing distance, 
and all this — my work in the tower, yours m the cottage 
these walks together — will seem to have been a false inter- 
lude Things remembered from a dream Unless m the 
end, we come to think of them as the only reality and all 
else as a dream ” 

He went on to speak of Julie with anxious tenderness, 
as if, Ramsdell reflected, she were a child who was soon 
to be cast adrift upon the world, and so different was this 
view of her from Ramsdell’s own — for her clear intelli- 
gence of men and her power over them seemed to him her 
sufficient defence — that he thought No one could fear for 
Julie who has not already transformed her m his mind, and 
he searched Lewis’s face It was, indeed, the face of one 
under a spell Its expression, while Julie was being spoken 
of, was that of a deeply sensitive man entranced by a play, 
by a poem, by some profound and excluding enthusiasm, 
and Ramsdell remembered how Julie had surprised him by 
saying “Isn’t it perhaps cruel to make anyone very happy 
m this world?” She too is changed, he said She too is 
under a spell, but she sees beyond it as he does not — or 
will not From the words “will not” and his understand- 
ing that, while Julie was still four-square with the world, 
knowing herself to be a creature of infinite adaptations, 



THE FOUNTAIN

Lewis was cherishing an idea of an impossible perma- 
nence, there emerged a sudden fear for both of them, and 
to test Lewis he said “To think of what is past as the only 
reality is to deny life itself, to be dead You are not looking 
forward to that ? ” 

“I am trying to carry this dream into the future,” 
Lewis answered “To establish it To make it so much a 
part of myself that whatever the circumstances of my life 
may become ” 

“But that is to tell yourself a fairy tale, and even m fairy 
tales the spells are lifted at last — the good as well as the 
evil ” 

“That’s one of the great mysteries,” Lewis said “In 
all the fairy tales there are miracles, and the miracles 
are m conflict, the good with the bad, and it is only when 
the miracles have ceased and the prince and princess 
have come together as man and woman that the story- 
teller dares to say, ‘And they lived happily ever after- 
ward ’ There’s very seldom any suggestion that there will 
be new miracles to help them in the future Yet the 
miracles and spells and enchantments were not put into 
the stones as meaningless decorations, they are built into 
the conclusion An evil spell is worked off by the perform- 
ance of tasks — generally they are impossible tasks, such as 
the carrying of water m a sieve, which are made possible 
by the intervention of benevolent spirits m the solitary 
struggles of man And even the beautiful spells, the 
happiest enchantments ” 

He broke off and walked for a little while m a silence 
that Ramsdell did not break 

“Even the happiest enchantments,” he continued after 
reflection, “end at last, when they have served their pur- 
pose One of three brothers misses his opportunity be- 
cause he does not recognize a fairy m the beggar-woman 
beside the road, the second misses it because he is m such 
haste to be about his business that he doesn’t pause to 
look into her face, and the third, the fortunate one, who 
recognizes and serves her and receives her favours — even 
he would lose his reward if he had not wisdom enough to

assimilate it When he leaves the enchanted place, carry* 
mg his reward with him, he must not look back He may 
take with him only what he carries within himself— that 
is, what he has become— and he may not look back He 
must go straight on into whatever world may be Then the 
story-teller dares a happy ending which is also an ironic 
one, he brings us down to earth 'And they lived happily 
ever after/ he says It’s always the beginning of a new 
story as well as an end of the old It is the key with which 
he takes us from one world into another 'And now/ he 
says, 'a new chapter of their lives began in which they 
related imagination with experience, and illusion with 
necessity, and this they were able to do because they had 

been taught by wonder and suffering ’ ” 

“By suffering?” Ramsdell said, and Lewis, slackening 
his pace which had increased while he spoke, answered 
laughing “But if you ask me about fairy tales, you must 
expect a lecture I’m sorry The subject is full of mysteries 
— as Dirk van Leyden knew ” 

How far they had wandered from their discussion of the 
war! So it was always during these walks Habit had deter- 
mined a route for them and the changes m its landmarks 
were tokens of the passing year — the softened shape of a 
copse against the sky-lme telling of winter’s departure, the 
movement of colour m a cottage garden proving the ap- 
proach of spring The owner of the garden, a frail Belgian 
m black suit and straw hat — the costume of the cafe in 
Namur from which he was exiled — shambled down to his 
gate as the Englishmen drew near He wanted, he said, to 
set his watch by theirs, but there was little fault m his 
Watch, he wished only to chatter of the war with allies and 
to say “The English are just They will restore my pro- 
perty to me, will they not? They will see justice in Belgium 
We, after all, have done our part ” To escape from his 
querulousness, they would ask of his garden, but he could 
not praise it without adding that in any country but Hol- 
land — his contempt for Holland was all-embracing "They 
think the Belgians fools for having fought and they expect 
us to be grateful to them for their chanty 1” When there

was a heavy snowfall in the second week m April “What 
a country!” he cried “How can a man live m it 1 ” And the 
sudden heat of early May pleased him no better “Look,” 
he said, squeezing the sweat from his wrists, “here is 
the summer But in Holland they have summer before 
the leaves are out on the trees The season is a month 
behind ” 

Lewis and Ramsdell were always glad to leave him, but 
they did not avoid his cottage, a visit to it having become 
part of their routine When Ballater was with them, the 
visit was prolonged, for Ballater was irritated by the Bel- 
gian’s horticulture, which no persuasions would change, 
and argument would be continued m fierce French until 
the Belgian’s daughter appeared by chance from the back 
of the cottage and, having shown by little fluttenngs of her 
hands how surprised she was to see the Englishman, stared 
at Ballater with the eyes of a child outside a pastry-cook’s 
shop His daughter? “Nonsense,” Ballater would say, “I 
don’t believe she’s his daughter She’d escape sometimes 
if she were Not that I’ve any real interest in her Her 
neck is too short ” Often they left him in the Belgian’s 
garden, for he never tired of inventing ruses to trick the 
man into leaving him alone with the girl Neither failure 
in this nor her short neck discouraged him She was a 
woman and she admired him, that was enough 

But as summer increased, Ballater’s absences from the 
cottage became longer and more frequent, and Ramsdell, 
being often alone with Lewis or with Julie, began to know 
them, through his intuitions of their relationship, with pro- 
found knowledge, and to guess, as one guesses of people 
m a tale, what they were discovering, or might discover 
One morning when he and Julie, having met by chance 
in the little wood that divided the upper lake from the 
road, were walking there together m sight of the Castle, 
she looked across the water to the tower and said 

“You know — don’t you? — what Lewis and I are to each 
other?” 

“Yes ” 

“How did you guess? Tell me how you guessed!” 



ch iv THE TOWER 261 

What a child still m her eager voice, her unguarded 
impulse t 

“You are both changed,” Ramsdell began, “m a way 
that ” 

“Well? In what way?” 

“There’s a repose between you when you are together, 
and when I meet you singly, you speak of each other ” 

“But to you only,” she insisted, defending herself 
against a charge of guilelessness “I never speak of Lewis 
to anyone but you, except m a casual way ” 

“Then no one else guesses, of course,” he answered with 
a smile 

Instantly the childishness left her “It doesn’t matter to 
me who guesses,” she said 

“Someone does?” 

“Sophie But she can prove nothing She prowls about 
the passages at night I think she’s half mad Once she 
came to the door of my bedroom and knocked, hoping to 
find Lewis there, and found nothing And once, guessing 
that Lewis wasn’t m his own room, she crept into the 
library If she had found it empty, I suppose she would 
have locked the door on the tower-staircase, then have 
given the alarm Lewis would have been trapped But it 
happened that Lewis was m the library, sitting there m the 
dark She was as frightened as if she had seen a ghost, and 
when he spoke to her could think of nothing better to say 
than that she had come for a book But she knows,” Julie 
added 

“Then why does she say nothing?” 

“Because no one would believe her Uncle Pieter least 
of all ” 

Ramsdell understood now that, though she was fright- 
ened, it was not Sophie she feared 

“Tell me,” she said “You see things plain as Lewis 
doesn’t, as I don’t now ” She walked away from him a 
few paces, turned and came back “Tell me what’s best 
to do ” And before he could speak, she added “I believe 
that — I believe that my mother knows ” 

In the midst of that sentence she had changed her mind 



262 


THE FOUNTAIN 


IV 


“That isn’t what you were going to say,” he answered, 
and she smiled at him, the disarming smile of one dis- 
covered in a trick 

“My mother does know,” she said “It’s more than sus- 
picion with her She has made that clear enough — to me, 
not to Lewis ” And she added with pleased quietness “But 
my mother will say nothing That would break my mar- 
riage, which was of her making She would say nothing — 
except to me — if I had twenty lovers ” 

The brutality of that phrase surprised him No girl is 
quite sane, he thought, when she speaks of her mother and 
her lover m a single breath 

Julie was laughing at him “Now I have shocked you!” 
“No, but you are playing with me A moment ago you 
were asking me what it was best that you should do Now 
you say that Sophie guesses and you don’t care, that your 
mother knows — and will never speak And yet you are 

frightened of something ” 

“Frightened? I — frightened?” 

“So frightened,” he answered, “that you are trying to 
deceive me — and yourself ” 

She compressed her lips and did not reply A sharp 
imperious movement of her head declared that she would 
not be scolded, a flash of her eyes that she was calling 
anger to her aid Then, the barriers down, she confessed 
“My husband knows ” 

“He has been told?” 

“He hasn’t been told But he knows ” 

“Certainly? He has written it ” 

“He has written nothing ” 

“You mean, then, that he suspects — that you believe 
he suspects?” 

“I know that he knows ” 

Ramsdell perceived that it would be vam to reason with 
her 

“If he does,” he said, “ — you care?” 

“Desperately ” 

“Why? Do you love him?” 

“No one but Lewis ”

“Then?” 

One of the gardeners had come down to the boat-house 
and, taking a boat, had launched himself on to the upper 
lake He was standing over his oars, facing for’ard, and 
as his body swung to and fro its reflection danced on the 
nppling, sunlit film of the water 

“I wonder what he is going to do on the island,” Julie 
said, standing to watch him, and not until the boat was 
concealed by the island’s trees did she turn to Ramsdell 
again and say 
“You hke Lewis?” 

“Yes ” 

“More than you did? You doubted him once ” 

“Not now ” 

“Why, I wonder?” 

“Never an easy question,” Ramsdell said, “but I can 
answer it, I think You see, m one aspect, he’s a solid, 
ordinary man That links him with me, I’m solid and 
ordinary He’s a good man of business, he’s capable of 
standing up to the world and doing his job, that made me 
want to like him I was willing to give to his ideas the 
respect one gives to another man’s religion — rather a cold, 
negative respect And then I found that you couldn’t be 
cold and negative about his ideas any more than you can 
be cold and negative when you’re standing by a black- 
smith who is hammering white-hot metal on his anvil 
The sparks fly and touch you Lewis is disturbing m the 
same way He doesn’t mterfere with anyone else, but it’s 
not possible to be with him and aloof from him What I 
doubted m him was his humanity I thought he was play- 
ing with barren theories ” 

“I know,” Julie said “But it’s not true I remember I 
used to think If Lewis is anything more than dry-as-dust, 
then he ought to be a leader of men I imagined him as a 
founder of a new religion — a new way of thought It was 
that kind of greatness I looked for in him and because he 
hadn’t got it — well ” 

“You despised him?” 

“No Never that But I tormented him I wanted to drag

him out of his solitudes I wanted to make him acknow- 
ledge — And then,” she added, “I wanted him I tried to 
laugh myself out of it I tried to break myself But I had 
come too close And afterwards I began to love him 
as I love him now That’s all He’s not a leader of men m 
the open He will never have a mob following him If he 
finds his own secret it will remain his own secret, but after 
he has gone and is forgotten the world will be changed by 
it ” 

“You have answered your own question for me,” Rams- 
dell said “Once he and I began to talk about fairy tales 
He said that, though life was empty without enchantments 
and miracles, no enchantment had any meaning until it 
had been assimilated in common existence A miracle is a 
seed and no more, you must plant it in earth and cultivate 
it if it is to bear fruit When he said that, I think he was 
understanding it for the first time, and perhaps I was 
understanding him for the first time And in the last few 
months — this winter and spring — I have learned more 
and more of him I don’t doubt him now ” 

“And I love him,” Julie said quietly Then “Do you 
think me a fool? What do you think of me?” 

“Need I tell you?” 

“Do you think that I am a woman who takes a delight 
m confusing men’s lives? Am I Lewis’s enemy?” 

Ramsdell stood uneasily, twining blades of grass over 
his fist 

“Are you taking a delight m confusing a man’s life at 
this moment?” he asked 

“I? Now? Your life?” 

“Good God'” Ramsdell exclaimed with a smile of 
self-mockery “Four syllables — and what destruction* 
Nothing is more dangerous than a beautiful woman who 
happens to forget how beautiful she is ” 

“Do you mean ” 

“No, Julie, I don’t mean that I love you More than the 
romantics suppose, love is a thing one permits or denies 
to oneself — after the earliest attacks before which we are 
all helpless But it makes me happy to walk here with

you It’s an odd privilege, half-agony and half-delight, to 
see you so aglow with your own life that you can say to 
me ‘ Your life?’ as if the possibility of your confusing it 
had never entered your mind And to hear you asking my 
advice as if you intended to take it— that’s good too But 
I’m m no condition,” he added, looking into her face, “to 
tell you whether you are Lewis’s enemy ” 

But she would not cease to be serious It was in her 
mind that she was bringing disaster to Lewis 
“Why?” Ramsdell asked “He has never done better 
work than he is doing now He has never been happier ” 
“That’s the danger,” she said 
“To be happy?” 

“As he and I are now ” 

“You believe in fate and the jealousy of the gods?” 

“It is happiness that compels belief m them ” 
“Because enchantments end?” 

She nodded and echoed “Because they end ” 

“Or are assimilated,” Ramsdell said quickly, and, paus- 
ing again to watch the boat return from the island, she 
replied 

“But ours can never be assimilated On earth, Lewis and 
I are opposed beings — anywhere but here What would 
happen to us, do you think, as man and wife?” 

“It wouldn’t be easy,” he admitted 
“Impossible Just a loyal, hopeless, loving lie — until we 
could deceive ourselves no longer ” 

“Is that why you are afraid?” She nodded again, her 
white teeth on her lip “Is that what you were thinking 
of when you said that your husband knew?” 

“Did I say that? I meant — it is as if he knew As if he 
were here watchingus, a ghost Every letter I have from him 
now seems to be beseeching me, to be saying that I am all 
he has left m the world and beseeching me not to leave his 
world empty It’s horrible It’s horrible because, though 
I’m sorry for him and for the suffering he’s going through, 
I don’t feel it in myself It’s as if he were writing to some 
other woman and I were stooping over his shoulder, 
reading her letter He writes to me in English and,

though his spoken English is nearly faultless, his written 
English is— just fluent, no more, he can't put himself into 
it At the end of each letter he falls away into German 
He writes it beautifully He says wise, tender, desperate 
things — always as if deep deep m his mind, hidden even 
from himself, was a knowledge that it was all m vam, that 
I didn't love him and never could, that he was writing to 
someone irretrievably lost " 

“Are you lost to him?" Ramsdell said “You will go 
back to him " 

“Yes," she answered, “if he lives, I shall go back But 
the woman he loves is lost — if ever she existed " 

Ramsdell had picked up a handful of pebbles and was 
tossing them one by one into the lake There was a ques- 
tion in his mind that he hesitated to utter, and it was a 
relief to him to turn away from Julie and watch only the 
intersection of the rippling circles on the water What 
would Julie do — what would Lewis do? — if Narwitz were 
killed? “If he lives," she had said the chance of his death 
was present with her And she was so happy that she 
believed m fate and the jealous gods 1 He emptied his 
hand of pebbles with a single, angry fling It would be a 
pretty tnck of the jealous gods to destroy Narwitz and, 
by removing that convenient obstacle to another marriage, 
thrust, with all the forces of honour and convention and 
sentiment, a freezing permanence on Julie's and Lewis's 
enchantment Could they part then? Would not he stand 
by honour and she by sentiment? 

“And if your husband is killed' 1 " he said over his 
shoulder “What then?" He would not look at her, for 
then he would cease to observe, with self-protective irony, 
a victim of the jealous gods, and would see the girl whose 
every mood, even when it angered, yet beguiled him 
“He must not be killed," she said 
“How can you say that — 'mus t not'?" He turned on her, 
his anger blazing “Must he live for your convenience?" 

She drew back, her eyes wide, the colour gone from her 
lips And, as though she were drawing a sword, she said 
“He must live for my ” and stopped 



ch iv THE TOWER 267 

What word? She would not speak it Instead she touched 
Ramsdell’s hand 

“We will not quarrel,” she said “Never mind what I 
meant It wasn’t as base as you thought ” 

They went down to the bridge and crossed between the 
lakes In front of the Castle, Lewis met them, his morning’s 
work done, and Ramsdell returned to the cottage alone 

“He must live for my ” What word? My pleasure? My 

concealment? My comfort? All were impossible No word 
would fit her sentence and her mood and her character 
But as he stood m the verandah of the cottage the word 
salvation appeared m his mind and he stood to ponder 
over it, there bemg no other less unexpected, and none, he 
began to think, more illuminating 



CHAPTER FIVE 


During this summer, Lewis consistently attempted to 
define his philosophical position m its relation to the 
contemporary world All his study urged upon him that 
there was a great division of method, though not of prin- 
ciple, between Christian and non- Christian contempla- 
tives The principle of detachment was common to the two 
groups, each sought the establishment of a citadel within 
the sensible world, but whereas the Christians desired, m 
varying degrees, identification with God, or communion 
with him, or, m the extreme instance of St Juan of the 
Cross, an absolute submission to a god having no re- 
semblance to any living creature, the non-Christians had 
no such external focus of their endeavours and their idea 
of contemplation impelled them to mastery, rather than to 
hatred, of the nature of man To them the body was a 
child that must grow m self-discipline, not a fiend and an 
instrument of the fiend 

And though there were certainly few, even among 
Catholics, who to-day accepted in its fullness St Juan’s 
doctrine of a journey towards an incomprehensible god 
through a night of the sense and a night of the intellect, 
there were many who, beneath the remote, unsuspected 
but still powerful influence of mediaeval Christianity, 
associated the contemplative ideal with asceticism and the 
abandonment of reason m faith It was the fierce negative 
of St Juan, not the courage of St Clement or the profound 
independence of Eckhart, that gave colour to the thoughts 
of men ignorant of the teachings of them all That this was 
so, was the outstanding weakness of the Reformation It 

268 



ch v THE TOWER 269 

had failed to implant in the minds of its adherents an 
effective distinction between the contemplative ideal itself 
and the extreme practices with which, m the Middle Ages 
and even more closely m the period of the Counter Re- 
formation, that ideal became associated 
As time went by, this distinction became more and more 
clear to Lewis It was, he saw, the link between the con- 
ditions of the modern world, wherein faith m revealed 
truth was no longer predominant, and the philosophic 
mysticism of the pre-Christian era To establish a citadel 
within the sensible world without first annihilating the 
senses, to build the spirit not with the deaths of mmd and 
body but with their selective and disciplined vitality, to 
lead the whole man, fearless and undivided, into that peace 
which is invulnerable and requires no immortal armour — 
these were his purposes, and he knew that to achieve them 
a man must be stronger than the Christian saints Not only 
must he be wedded in spirit to nothing mortal and conquer 
that fear for the loss of earthly pleasures which the saints 
also overcame, but he must be without terror, as they 
seldom were, of the impact of earthly forces, and, as they 
could never be, of the loss of immortality They were 
bound to the fulfilment of their faith, as a rich man to 
his riches, but a modern contemplative, excluded from 
Christianity, must be, like Socrates, bound to nothing, 
afraid of no encounter, capable of no loss but of his own 
integrity Though he were persuaded by reason or intui- 
tion of the immortality of the soul and this persuasion 
were indistinguishable in effect from faith, yet it was not 
faith won from revelation, he must be prepared for reason 
to unmake what it had made, and though he believed m 
God, he must carry his god within him — an eye to see all 
lights, not an external beacon which, if he were to miss his 
view of it, would leave him blinded 
Under the compulsion to these thoughts, Lewis’s own 
life revealed new aspects to him There were periods in 
which his pleasure m the detachment of his present exist- 
ence ceased to contain any element of fear Instead of 
feeling, as he had, that there was an impassable barrier

between himself who was secluded in the tower and the 
dutiful man of affairs who wrote letters to his partner m 
business, he became aware of a unity between them, as 
though each were a necessary complement of the other, 
and he looked forward, not with resignation, but with an 
acceptance neither eager nor distressed, to the day when 
he should re-enter the world I shall not, he thought, 
return to Alison and Ford, for I have other work to do, but 
while he was m these moods of reconciliation he felt no 
revulsion from his former tasks He could even be free for a 
little while of knowledge that time was passing and that 
an interlude m his life was slipping away The wheeling 
shafts of sun and moon on the library walls, the sound of 
the waterfall, the mysterious sense of a multiplied blessing 
from the hours themselves, which arises m one who hears 
the night and the day chant through his solitudes, armed 
him against time and misfortune, and when, during August, 
Julie was absent for a week, she seemed often to be present 
with him, so woven together were her life and his The 
parting, which he had feared, was not a parting m effect 
until, on the eighth day, the day before her return, the 
mood of security forsook him Its protection gone, he be- 
came as he had been in the past He could not work, he 
could be calm neither alone nor m company, the could think 
of nothing but that when Julie laughed, a little triumphant 
laugh full of malicious gaiety, she would look up under 
eyebrows that she made seem severe — then raise her eye- 
brows to mock him and lift her face to be kissed More 
than a year ago, he remembered, she had thus tantalized 
him, for then, though he might not kiss her, the quick 
upward movements of her head and the rounding of her 
lips had always been her last thrust m an unspoken duel 
between them He felt again the jealous, eager tingling of 
his body that he had felt m the past, and was possessed by 
his former illusion of the senses, contrary to reason, that 
she, so lithe and firm, was little more than a child, and 
virginal It was an illusion that charged his being with 
apposed adoration and desire, and, while he was trembling 
in a conflict of images, it seemed to him suddenly that

what had appeared as memories of her shape and warmth 
and movement were but hallucinations, and that a being 
at once so remote, so beautiful, so feminine as she could 
never have been his in the flesh In that instant of fear he 
lost her — not as if she had come, been possessed by him 
and gone, but as if she had never lived except m his 
imagination, and, looking wildly round the library, coming 
to a desperate halt and staring into its spaces, he drew his 
breath m a panic of loss 

“Did you miss me?” she whispered when she returned, 
and before he could answer she was away among the others, 
pouring out a tale of her adventures And next morning, 
awaking m the first gleam of summer dusk, feeling, when 
he moved, the weight of her beside him, he lay still and 
gazed at the fluted post of the bed nearest to the light and 
the lion’s head under the canopy He would not wake her, 
but watched the morning increase upon her pillow Her 
lashes lay darkly on her lower lids, her lips made so soft a 
contact that they were neither open nor closed, her hand, 
lying beside her head, with white palm exposed and fingers 
gently curving, seemed to be on the point of movement 
If she should wake, he would become aware of that stress 
of will and consciousness, that struggle to communicate, 
which is inseparable from all human companionship, even 
that of love Their relationship, like a ship cast off from 
mght-moormgs, would move out into the current of ex- 
perience, but while she slept, while her own consciousness 
of him was suspended, he felt himself to be part of a single 
being m which he and she were included 

It was not necessary even that he should look at her, 
and he lay apart, thinking how great a miracle it was that 
without sight of her, without touch or any communication 
of the senses, he should yet be mingled with her If she 
died m her sleep, the consciousness of their mingling 
would persist while he gazed at the carved manes of the 
lions and the tall windows turnmg to gold, and if I died, 
he said, would this stream of consciousness cease, should I 
be aware of loss? It seemed to him then as impossible that 
he should lose her as that his consciousness should be

emptied of his own being, but the insatiable curiosity of 
love caused him to look at her again She stirred m her 
sleep, her hair fell back from her temples, her lips moved, 
she lifted her hand as though warding off an approach 
m a dream, then, with a gentle sigh, let her hand fall on 
the sheet, where its ivor> fingers lay extended The idea 
entered Lewis’s mind that in her dream she had been 
afraid, that her sigh was of relief, her fear being past, and 
all his thought was of how the day of their separation was 
falling upon them like a sword It was intolerable now to 
be parted from her even by her sleep, he longed for her 
eyes, her voice, the swift grace of her limbs, and he was 
stooping down to awaken her when her lips moved again 
and, as though she were whispering into his ear — for now 
his face was near to hers — she said “No No Rupert, it 
isn’t true It isn’t true ” And after an interval of heavy, 
troubled breathing she repeated the name, and sighed 
deeply, and awoke 

No memory of her dream remained with her She drew 
Lewis’s face down to her and kissed him, then, seeing how 
far the sunrise was advanced and that the hour when Lewis 
must return to his own room was approaching, she folded 
herself close to him and begged him not to leave her 

“Shall it be a holiday to-day? Let’s picnic on the island 
among the trees ” And she added “If we knew that 
within a week we must die, how should we spend to-day, 
Lewis?” 

“If it is to be a holiday,” he said, “let us go far away on 
to the moors How you love your island*” 

“And you your moors* O Lewis,” she said, “what does 
it matter where we go? This is the last summer we shall 
spend together ” She moved away from him and, turning 
on to her face, hid her eyes m the darkness of her hands 
and her hands m the darkness of her pillow Her bare 
shoulders were glossy under the honeyed glow of the sky, 
her side was golden above the pallor of linen, and when, 
thinking she wept, he would have comforted her, she 
whispered 

“Wait 


Wait ” 



CH V 


THE TOWER 


273 

Suddenly she sat up, threw back her hair, looked at him 
under eyebrows she had drawn down with her old severity 
“I was hiding m the dark — the deep, private, secret 
dark Do you know why? Because there will be sun all day 
and ” 

“And all day we shall be together/’ he said 
“And it is summer still The leaves have not begun to 
turn on the trees,” she answered “Have you seen a jellow 
leaP Shall we look out of the window together and see 
whether September is coming' 5 ” But she stretched out 
her hand and laughed and seized his wrist “No,” she 
said, “why should we look out?” 

But the days were fast shortening, and Lewis, who had 
been accustomed to spend one or two afternoons in each 
week riding with van Leyden over his estates, heard him 
grumble that the summer was over “I hate the winter,” 
he said, “it ties me to my desk and makes a clerk of me ” 
The foliage of the avenue was the first to change its colour, 
but autumn spread to the little hills surrounding the lakes, 
and one day, while Lewis and Julie were standing near 
the boat-house, a fierce gust brought down a torrent of 
leaves and the surface of the water was lively with a golden 
fleet The gold vanished, the sodden leaves drifted on for 
a little while, a mottle of black on steel 
As though even the seasons were m haste, storms blew 
through the sunshine of that autumn, and soon the pattern 
of branches stood everywhere naked against the skj No- 
thing remained but the dark glitter of evergreens which 
clacked and hissed as the breeze jostled them At last the 
winds ceased The lakes were grey and dull and motion- 
less, speckled with a sleety ram In the early weeks of 
December the earth was saturated by snow and thaw, 
the sky, whether dark or pale, was unlummous, and all 
the interior of the Castle — the rugs, the polished tables, 
the gilt frames, the silver — seemed to have sunk into 
a lethargy Colour itself had fallen asleep Shape was 
emptied of its vitality Furniture stood, dead, among 
sombre shadows, one remembered its weight — neither

its beauty nor its strength, and a figure seen in sickly 
illumination at the end of a long corridor, or touched by 
the white gloom of windows at the head of the great stair- 
case, had the appearance of a wraith which advanced and 
vanished and appeared again, formless m that struggling 
fantasy of light 

Lewis had completed his first sifting and annotations 
of Dirk van Leyden’s papers The translations, with 
Julie’s aid, were done In a couple of months, perhaps — 
certainly m the early spring — his selection and final order- 
ing would be finished “And I shall have no more reason 
then to live m the tower,” he said 
“Then you must play Penelope,” Julie answered 
“Uncle Pieter will never know how near you are to the 
end Besides, where should you go?” 

“To the cottage,” Lewis said 
“And I?” 

They let the subject drift away from them until one 
morning Ballater came m through a blizzard to say that 
his uncle was dead His cheeks were pink, his eyes spark- 
ling, he stood by the stove m the library, warming his hands 
and rubbing them, he did what he could to seem grave 
and mournful but could not conceal his joy 
“That means the Ballater acres for you?” Lewis asked 
Ballater grinned “It means more than that It means 
leave to England They granted it to Jerram when his 
father died, they’ll grant it to me And once m England, 
it’s easy enough to get parole extended and extended If 
the war ends next spring, I probably shan’t come back ” 
“Then you’ll leave the cottage — for good?” Julie said 
“What will Ramsdell do?” 

“Hasn’t decided Probably live m the Hague or join 
up with the people at Haarlem ” He looked round him at 
the long windows and the crowded shelves, at the table 
spread with Lewis’s pipes, at Lewis himself and Julie, 
then searchmgly at the door that barred the walled stair- 
case to her room 

“It’s odd,” he said “Next spring I should have been m 
Enkendaal two years Now I’m going away and I haven’t

been m this library a dozen times Do you like sitting 
and working here? I should never have thought Julie 
would ” 

“But I love working with Lewis,” Julie answered She 
had intended to make no more reply than this, she would 
disarm Ballater’s curiosity with her candour — then be 
silent, but there was that in her mind — a sense of the 
breakmg-up of beloved associations, a shiver of farewell — 
which touched her with sudden madness, and she said to 
Ballater “I shall always remember this moment The books 
grey and cold, the top shelves in darkness, this light every- 
where, pearly and opaque — as if we were all living xn an 
oyster shell, and you standing there by the stove like a vast, 
grey giraffe I suppose some day I shall come back You 
never will When you go out of this room, you’ll never, 
never enter it again But I shall come back years on And 
I shall see you quite easily as you are now, standing by the 
stove I shall wait and struggle, and perhaps I shall see 
Lewis again — there, at that table, with his long fingers 
running up the edge of a book But I shall not see myself ” 

After a silence, because he knew not what else to say, 
Ballater said 

“The waterfall makes more noise now than it’s ever done 
— the lakes are so swollen with snow and ram Doesn’t it 
worry you, working here?” 

“No,” Lewis answered, “you forget it Only if it stopped 
you’d remember ” 

Ballater went out Julie had seated herself on a stool near 
to the shelves and her head was turned away 

“Julie Tell me what you are frightened of?” 

She rose and stood beside the table “Lewis, dear, I’m 
ashamed when I — when I’ve broken down like that It’s 
these dark skies, day after day, like a tomb That — and my 
own weakness — and time sliding away under our feet — and 
your strength That more than all ” 

“My strength?” 

“You have changed,” she said 

“Not towards you, Julie ” 

She smiled “Sometimes, when you think of the end,

you are afraid, as I am But there’s a part of you that isn’t 
afraid — not even of losing me A part that’s independent 
It is what you have been fighting for — your tranquillity, 
the seed or it And since I have loved you, it is what I 
have wanted for you O Lewis, it’s true, I have wanted it 
for you, but it divides you from me Not now, you love 
me, perhaps, if we lived together all our lives, you would 
love me always, but every hour of every day, we should 
become more and more different beings ” She sank down 
beside him and pressed his hand against her face “And 
so,” she said, “when we part, though it will kill something 
m each of us, still it will be best When we began I thought 
so, now I know it Here we are close together, but m the 
world we should grow further and further apart I believe 
that is true, but it seems a waste of life, Lewis, I don’t 
understand it ” 

“Perhaps it is not true,” Lewis said 

“Perhaps 1 ” she repeated “But you too believe it 
“Listen I’ll prove it If Ballater and Ramsdell leave the 
cottage, if you finish Dirk’s papers and go from here — you 
could live m the cottage alone> without loss? If I died, 
then ” 

“Julie!” he exclaimed, lifting her up “These months 
with you have been more to me than all my life without 
you I came here cold and proud and ignorant and blind 
Now ” 

“But you could live alone,” she insisted “Not perhaps 
without loss, there’s a part of you that would suffer But 
there is a part that would be stronger because I was gone 
It’s true And there’s a part of me,” she cried, throwing 
up her head and speaking as though her words were being 
dragged from her, “there’s a part of me that would be 
freer — more gay, lighter, harder, more brilliant — if you 
were gone But it is the worst m me that would profit and 
perhaps the best m you Lewis, what is it that we are 
learning of each other? We shall part with the lesson half 
learned You will go on You stumble, you are blind some- 
times, but nothing m your life is wasted For you every- 
thing comes together in the end But for me everything is

broken into little pieces I love you, but it’s all like a story 
half told As if the book with the story in it were to be 
shut suddenly and carried away I don’t know how the 
story ends — or why it was begun ” 

“But the book isn’t shut yet,” Lewis said “We are 

listening to it now and ” 

“Soon it will be,” she answered 
“Why do you say that 5 ” 

She hesitated “I know it I tell myself over and over 
again that we have time After the winter the spring, after 
the spring another summer— who knows 5 1 tell myself that 
But it’s not true,” she cned, “it’s not true ” 

And Lewis heard m her voice the same accent of fear 
that had been in it when she spoke her husband’s name 
in her sleep “It isn’t true It isn’t true ” But again she 
passed beyond the terror that had possessed her, and said 
“Perhaps I’m being a fool, dearest one I will go up to 
my music-room and play myself into reason and leave you 
to your own work ” 

He seized her hand, it was trembling, and m her eyes 
was a secret that she could not share with him, an intui- 
tion which swung as yet beneath the surface of her mind 
so that sometimes it was brightly visible and she shrank 
away from it, but sometimes she could forget that it was 
there 


K 



CHAPTER SIX 


At the opening of the new year, the fourth of war, Lewis 
became certain that there was a burden on Julie’s mind 
that she could not share with him When he spoke to her 
of it, she would elude him by saying “Perhaps it’s only 
something I imagine,” and, if he pressed her further, would 
so beseech him with her eyes and the tones of her voice 
not to force her concealments that he felt he was hurting 
her by his urgency, and allowed himself to be led away to 
other subjects She will tell me in her own time, he said 
In her own time she told him He had been across to 
the cottage and had spent an afternoon there Soon after 
Ballater’s leaving for England, Ramsdell had gone to Haar- 
lem and the English servants had been sent away, but 
Ramsdell might return if Lewis ceased to live in the Castle, 
and the rooms they had occupied m the cottage were still 
full of their possessions Among these Lewis had been 
searching for a pipe that Ramsdell wished to have sent to 
Haarlem, and, though the pipe was soon found, he had 
stayed long m the cottage, talking to Vrouw Kerstholt It 
was already dark when he returned to the Castle 
He went to his bedroom and prepared for dinner As he 
entered the drawing-room, voices that had been uplifted 
were suddenly, though but for a moment, hushed Then 
the Baroness said 

“But how long have you known? You must have known 
before this Why didn’t you tell us before?” 

Julie, with her back to a table, was clutching its edge 
with her fingers and leaning against it Her heels were 
raised from the ground and she had the same air of defiance

that had been hers long ago on the tennis-ground when 
van Arkel had challenged her with news of Jutland So 
strong was the association in Lewis’s mind between the 
two scenes that he supposed for an instant that the German 
spring offensive — “their last shot when it comes,” the 
Baron had said — was already begun, and he asked “Is there 
news?” 

“Yes,” Julie answered, flattening all tone out of her 
voice m her effort to control it “Rupert is coming here ” 
She was pale and stern, with eyes feverishly bright “He is 
hurt almost to death — invalided out — useless to them any 
more He’s coming here — ” and she added, with a twist 
of terror and pride that tautened the words, “here — to me ” 
She looked everywhere but at Lewis — at the Baron with 
a sliding, negative glance as though he were of no interest 
to her, at Sophie with violence and contempt, then at her 
mother fixedly The Baroness was in a flutter of annoyance 
because she had not been informed and because Narwitz, 
in his letters, had evidently deceived her, her irritation 
over these trifles obscured at first every other consideration 
m her mind and she poured out questions m an angry 
stream Julie replied with unnatural calm, though a little 
breathlessly, as women often do m the witness-box In the 
autumn, after Rupert was wounded a third time, he had 
known that he would never return to the front and had 
expected to die She had never believed that he would 
die Why? She didn’t know why, but she had not 
believed it Then, after a long time, he had written of the 
possibility of his obtaining leave to come to Holland That 
was long ago — well, several weeks ago 
“But why didn’t you tell us then? Why didn’t he tell us?” 
“Because I didn’t believe he’d really come,” Julie said, 
leaving the second question unanswered And she added 
“He is only coming here to die ” 

“To die 1 ” her mother exclaimed 
Julie replied m a hard, bitter tone “His right arm is 
amputated His right shoulder and his back are terribly 
injured The earlier wounds remain And gas ” she 
continued to tell them of his sufferings m such a way that a

stranger might have supposed her to be without pity for 
them, she seemed to be reading from a document At the 
end, after a stifled pause, she said 4 4 He has what one of 
the orderlies called 4 the frozen sickness * He meant by that 
just dying — dying — worn out — not having the will to live — 
wanting to get out of the pam But here, Rupert says, he 
will live ” She repeated it as though she had been con- 
tradicted 44 He says — here he will live ” 

4< Is it on Friday he comes?” her mother asked 
Julie counted the days, a smile moving over her face 
44 Three days,” she answered 44 He will cross the frontier 
on Wednesday and stay a day and two nights at the Lega- 
tion He is formally attached to the Legation and will be 
granted leave from there ” 

“Then we must meet him You, at any rate ” 

But Julie shook her head 44 He says, No He wants to 
come here alone He says he is not an easy travelling 
companion ” 

“But not to meet him ” the Baroness began 

“Ah, leave him alone Let it be as he chooses,” her 
husband interrupted “Journeys are hard for sick men We 
must have nurses here ” 

“I will nurse him,” Julie said 

“But if there are wounds to be dressed?” 

“I think he is past that ” 

“Perhaps But there must be one nurse to relieve 
you ” 

While this conversation proceeded, Lewis had been 
silent, the counting of the days, the argument of one nurse 
or two, ringing m his mind as the disputed detail of 
common life rings always through the deepest silences 
Jacob announced dinner and they began to move out of 
the drawing-room 

“It’s as well I’ve finished Dirk’s manuscripts,” Lewis 
said “You won’t want me here, sir ” 

After dinner, he went early to his bedroom, then to the 
library, putting his papers together Juke, carrying a candle 
from which the grease had overflowed on to her hand, 
came up the stair from the empty banqueting-hall

“Where shall you go?” she asked 
“To the cottage Vrouw Kerstholt will look after me 
until I can get a Dutch servant m ” 

“Not to the Hague, then?” 

“Not yet Ramsdell may come back ” 

She sat down quietly 

“Lewis,” she said, “I don’t think I can bear this He’s 
a stranger to me I don’t know him ” 

“How long have you known that he was coming?” 

“In my heart, a long time It seems now as if I’d 
always known ” 

“You wouldn’t tell me?” 

“I wouldn’t tell myself ” 

Because he did not intend to work that evening, Lewis 
had not remade the fire m the open stove The colour was 
almost gone from it, the peat was crumbling into ashes, 
the room was growing cold But a little blaze sprang up, 
a primrose tongue blue-edged, and Julie stretched out her 
fingers to it 

“You will be here, in Enkendaal, though you can’t stay 
in the Castle,” she said, seeming to explore her own 
thought The light of the fire flowed up wrist and arm to 
her throat and cast deep upward shadows on her face — 
a face which, as Lewis watched it, began to wear a closed 
and secretive expression, like a flower that folds itself at 
the approach of wind or darkness As though by repeating 
a lie she might persuade herself to believe it, she said, 
“He’s a stranger to me I was a child when I married, and 

now ” But the lie would not serve and she let it fall in 

silence, drawing herself up in her chair, leaning her head 
backward, forcing herself to look into Lewis’s face When 
he bent down to kiss her, she encircled him with her arms, 
whispering “This isn’t the end for us, Lewis dear Right 
or wrong, I can’t bear it now Not yet ” 

His silence and his trembling assented 

“For a little while after he comes we shall be parted But 

afterwards,” she said, “m the spring, m the summer ” 

She was struggling to speak lightly Against her nature 
and intuition she forced a hard carelessness upon herself,

as though by her husband’s coming nothing was of neces- 
sity changed between them, but her defiance snapped m 
her like a tautened string, she knew, and had long known, 
that the future held for her a challenge not to be averted by 
any contrivance — the inescapable challenge of self to self, 
and she would not face it Was she now saying farewell? 
A terror, wordless and almost without thought to give it 
form or substance, travelled upon her, like a hand over her 
body She was emptied of the passion that an instant before 
had been reckless within her and, releasing Lewis, she sat 
still, like a lost animal

CHAPTER ONE 


Sophie came m from the verandah, where she had been 
on watch for more than half an hour, to say, exulting 
“Here it is J Here’s the car, Julie, it’s past the lodge 1 ” and 
Julie without answering went out on to the steps before 
the front door, where she found her mother and Uncle 
Pieter 

The trees of the avenue were tossing their heads m a 
March wind that had freshened since morning, and a rug, 
which had partly broken loose among the baggage on the 
roof of the car, was inflated like a balloon, tugging lop- 
sided 

It was something to watch as the car drew near, and 
Julie gazed at it, pressing her skirt down against the 
swirling gusts 

Jacob at the bottom of the steps opened the door of the 
car but no one came out “Catch that rug,” Uncle Pieter 
shouted, “it will blow away,” and when Julie looked down 
again from the rug a broad-backed woman at Jacob’s side 
was leaning into the car “Go and help the nurse,” Julie 
heard her mother say, but she could not move, and indeed 
the figure that emerged appeared to need little help or to 
be unwilling to accept it Uncle Pieter and Sophie began 
to speak m German and Rupert’s voice answered them— 
a voice which had the distant and mysterious familiarity 
of a scent that, suddenly re-encountered, fills the mind 
with unidentified memories Nothmg but the voice was 
familiar, and the strangeness of the man from whom it 
proceeded — the shaggy whiteness of the moustache and 
the bared head, the bony pallor of the cheeks, the twist of

the body to the left, like the droop of a stiff rope not stiff 
enough to stand erect — deepened the voice’s incision into 
the past When he had climbed the steps, he came to Julie, 
releasing himself from the nurse, and wrenched at his body 
that he might straighten it Pain drew down the side of his 
mouth “My glove,” he said “There 1 ” and, when the 
nurse had taken his glove, he lifted Julie’s hands m his 
■one hand and tried to stoop to them 

“Rupert 1 ” she cried and moved forward half a pace, 
thinking he would kiss her, but he held fast her hands, his 
fingers folded over them, and said m English “Mv English 
name* To hear you speak it — that is what I wanted Nearly 
four years now I haven’t spoken yours — not aloud — not 
once — Julie ” He checked himself, dropped her hands 
“Let me lean on you I will not be heavy Let us go m ” 
He entered the hall with her, leaving the little group on 
the steps as though he had forgotten it 

“You are m pain?” she said, searching his face 

He nodded, silent 

“Always?” 

“A little ” He stood and waited She felt his arm stiffen 
and heavy tremors pass through his body “But to see 
you,” he said, driving the words from him, “alive, visible, 
tangible — to hear you — it’s like sunlight m a grave ” And 
suddenly with greater ease “Would you have — should 
you have known me? Which is good English?” He smiled 
for the first time “I could never learn that m the inter- 
rogative — ‘should’ or ‘would’ You must teach me I have 
been reading English — always, but I haven’t spoken it ” 
When he had lowered himself into a chair, he said 
again “Should you have known me?” 

“But Rupert ” 

“No The truth The truth I’m not afraid of it ” 
“Your voice — and now when you smiled, yes And now, 

of course, near you, more and more ” 

“My voice and my smile ” He turned his head away 
*Tt matters not very much — the body ” 

The nurse came in from the hall, the others following 
her He must go to his room and rest, they said They spoke

to him m the brisk, facetious tone of nurses, as though he 
were a child Yes, he answered, presently he would go to 
his room, the journey had exhausted him, but for a little 
while he would stay where he was, would rest in his chair 
It was said with a calm finality that could not be disputed 
Tea was brought m The external world seemed to be 
of little interest to him except when Julie alone represented 
it, and he spoke seldom, but none was embarrassed by his 
silence, for it was a silence neither of nervousness nor ill- 
temper but of repose Nothing stirred emotion m him but 
Julie’s voice and movement His eyes followed her as 
though he could never have proof enough of the wonder 
that she was alive and within his reach She found his look 
hard to interpret The plain interpretation of it — that to- 
night he would claim her — filled her with dread, and some- 
times she imagined that behind his blue eyes, which were 
certainly paler than her husband’s eyes had been, was 
knowledge of her fear, an agony m her shrinking When 
in the past she had refused him, or had yielded unw illing ly, 
she had seemed to strike him in the face with a whip, and 

had not greatly cared, but to strike him now 

She met his eyes, went near and spoke to him Perhaps 
he would not claim her But she found that to interpret 
his manner, his deep preoccupation with her and her only, 
in any other way, was to be enwrapped in a different fear — 
an awe of something unknown and ternble Like s unli ght 
in a grave, he had said and she began to think of him as 
one who had arisen from the grave and was discovenng 
in her, m her life, her being tangible, evidence of his 
resurrection When he put his hand on her, there was no 
greed in the touch but an awful faith which was confirmed 
by his finding that she was indeed no creature of his 
imagination, but flesh and blood 

“Now I will go to my room,” he said, “and I will say 
good-mght I shall not come down again ” A room had 
been prepared for him in the passage leading to the tower, 
it was within a few yards of Julie’s door, and leading out 
of it was another smaller room where his nurse would be 
within call “You may sleep quietly to-night,” he told the

nurse “I shall not have an attack I know when they are 
coming ” The nurse began to tell how he had had an 
attack last night in the Legation, “the first night I spent 
with him,” she added, “and I knew nothing of the case 
It isn’t asthma, you see, Mevrouw, though it looks like it 
at first It’s this gas And he has no position of relief ” 
“What did you mean,” Julie asked when the nurse came 
out of his room, saying that he was in bed, “what did you 
mean — ‘he has no position of relief’?” And the nurse ex- 
plained that asthmatics generally knew by experience of 
some position of the body that eased their suffering, “but 
f his,” she repeated, “isn’t asthma It’s the lungs them- 
selves that choke him And it is made worse because he 
can’t use the great muscles of his back as asthmatics do 
when they’re having their fight His muscles are twisted 
and shot away and his spine is touched ” She looked at 
Julie, thinking the girl’s heartless, she’ll stand anything 
I say, she was professionally angry because Julie had not 
cried out “Asthma may not be dangerous to life,” she 
said, “but this — it’s just how much he can stand — then 
there’s the heart ” 

“Do you mean he can’t live?” 

“One never says that ” 

“But you think it?” 

The nurse hunched her great shoulders “He’s a queer 
patient,” she said “Was he always like that? Why, the 
doctor said in the Hague, you might think it was happening 
to someone else — and so you might He don’t seem to care, 
not for all he’s going through ” 

“You mean he’s brave? He is brave ” 

“Well,” the nurse answered, “brave you can call it It’s 
as if there was a great noise going on — and he wasn’t 
listening Oh, and I was to say he wants to be alone 
now But this evening, before you go to bed, Mevrouw, 
you will go m, last thing?” 

On her way to bed Julie paused at his door but could 
not enter She went on to her own room, began to undress, 
hesitated, thrust her feet back into her shoes She must 
go to him now, as she was

He was propped high on many pillows, his eyes already 
on the door by which she entered 

“Have I kept you awake? Have you been waiting for me 
long?” 

“Very long, Julie ” 

There seemed to be nothing of the arm he stretched 
out to her but the protruding bone of the wrist and a flat 
forearm which gave an edge to his sleeve as though the 
silk were hanging on a plank of wood But his fingers had 
strength in them They took, not her hand but her flesh 
near the elbow, and his little finger moved on the inner 
curve of her arm She was to sit at his side, leaning against 
his pillows 

“Are you afraid of me, Julie?” 

“My dear, of course I’m not afraid Why should vou 
think that?” 

“You were always a little afraid, even m the past,” he 
said, and lifted his touch from her 

But she could not cease to tremble, for it was on the 
inner curve of her arm that Lewis’s hand would linger, 
and her mind was suddenly inflamed by thought of him 
The lamp on the table before her became a furry ball of 
radiance m her sight and the sheen of the coverlet was 
sliding like a waterfall into the floor’s darkness “I can’t 
move I can’t reach you,” Rupert was saying “Let your 
head come down to me,” and she lowered her head Her 
thought, straining away from him, came back to the dis- 
covery, which ran through her like the drag of a brier 
across her throat, that this kiss, the first he had given her, 
was for him a miracle He had stretched out his hand and 
touched the hem of a garment, he had kissed her, who was 
lifeless, and life itself had risen m him, shaking him with a 
sacred joy She spoke to him, faltering, empty, lying 
words, and he held her to him and kissed her breast and 
her knees and the palms of her hands, silently, always 
silently, as though his salvation were in his contact witn 
her She was frightened by his silence and by the beads of 
sweat that the unregarded agony of movement had thrown 
up on the bones of his cheeks Not now, not now, not

to-night, she cried within her, but she could not speak, she 
was imprisoned m his ecstasy, and if he had bidden her 
strip and lie down beside him would have obeyed She 
began to loathe, as an assault, the gentleness, the adora- 
tion, the blind humility of his love Her tongue ran over 
her lips In an instant she would have spoken any words 
of cruelty to break his power over her and let her be free 
But his movement ended On her breast, his head lay 
heavily and she saw that he was falling asleep After a 
little while he stirred and said m German, “You are 
crying, my Julie You must not cry All the world ” 
But already he was sleeping 

One of her fingers was clutched m his hand and, if he 
sighed, she felt his grip tighten When he began to moan 
in his sleep, he was quietened by her arm’s pressure Per- 
ceiving these things, she began to tremble again that so 
much power was confided m her, her mouth was dry and 
when she closed her eyes tears clung to her lashes An 
hour passed The candles stretched their flames and 
steadied, the fire was set, even the shadows moved no 
more She had only to hold him, that he might not slip 
from her breast 


Next morning Narwitz was awakened by pain, a custom- 
ary summons Though an agony of back and shoulder 
and a cord-like binding of his diaphragm were part of life, 
he had, m waking, less mastery of himself than at other 
times, and he cried out The nurse did not come at once 
When shall I learn control? When shall I learn * 5 he thought 
while he waited for her, repeating the phrase inwardly 
until it became part of pain’s rhythm 

She raised him from the stiffness m which he had been 
lying When she spoke m her own language he did not 
answer, for his Dutch had been learnt long ago, before his 
marriage, and while m pam he could not command it, but 
when she used German, asking what he felt, he forced 
himself to reply, not wishing to alarm her by silence “As 
if I’d gone to bed m a suit of armour and it had contracted

on me But it will ” It will pass, he would have said, 

but the armour choked him It was necessary to be silent 
that he might not cry out again 
“It will soon be day,” she said 
“Leave me then I’m more comfortable now,” he 
answered at last “I shall take care not to fall asleep again ” 
She was easily persuaded to return to her bed, leaving 
him to watch the unlighted candles borrow, inch by inch, 
a gleam from morning Pam slackened and he was lulled 
by the softness of relief— a joy he had learned to distrust 
If he yielded to it, he would be led into a languorous 
meditation on the body, his own broken and condemned 
body, and to think of the body, even m relief from pain, 
was to yield to it more than he dared yield Pam was like 
rising water In the past he had walked painless, on dry 
land Now the water had risen Sometimes it was very 
deep, sometimes it flung its darkness over his head and he 
descried only finality in the darkness But it was possible 
— wasn’t it ? — to float on this water, disregarding its ebb 
and flow, to recognize it as a necessary condition of life 
and, however its depths might increase, to float s till, 
aware but unaffected 

To compel his mind was not easy in the dusk of morning, 
and he had to wrench himself continually out of a despair 
m which all effort seemed vain With daylight, Julie will 
come, he said, but he found it hard to believe He had so 
often stayed himself with imagining of her that there 
seemed now to be some trick m the thought of her h mg 
asleep almost withm call She had sat last night on the 
edge of his bed, he had kissed her, but he could remember 
nothing of her going away She had faded from him as his 
visions of her had always faded in the past 
But morning came and she with it, carrying a tray 
“If you go to your breakfast,” she said to the nurse, “I 
will stay here,” and he told Julie that to see her with a 
tray in her hands had given him extraordinary pleasure, 
had endorsed her reality, dividing the present from the 
past “I never imagined you with a tray,” he added, 
smiling “This is real ” 



THE FOUNTAIN

He tapped the silver with his finger-nail and she replied 
suddenly “What is real? The silver? Why, of course ” 

She had not been listening, and he was about to explain 
to her that it was she, she herself, who had emerged from 
a visionary into a real existence, when he found that 
explanation was useless and foolish “What were you 
thinking of?” he asked 

“I was wondering what you would do all day,” she 
answered “You could sit m some sheltered place m the 
sun, and we might walk together a little if you feel strong 
enough ” 

How could he tell her with what delight her use of the 
word “we” had pierced him? It was recognition of a unity 
on which his courage and hope depended One by one, 
during the last four years, his ambitions and faiths had 
been taken from him Some he had outgrown, some that 
were substantial once had been made wraiths by his 
suffering, many had been broken by death Even the 
passion that had swept him into w^ar was spent Loyalty 
stood, but it was an endurance now, not an exaltation, 
and when he thought of his country, his Prussia, and of 
its struggle against a world in arms, he felt that he was 
watching the last act of a tragedy m which he himself had 
perished long ago She only remained, a vital epitome 
transcending loss, an immortality beyond all the deaths 
within him He could not tell her this, but he took her 
hand saying “Yes, we will walk together, Julie,” and she 
looked at him, surprised, almost frightened that he should 
be so deeply moved by so light a promise 



CHAPTER TWO 

Often during Rupert’s early weeks at Enkendaal, while 
she was still a stranger to his secrets, Julie was alarmed by 
his profound response to words or acts of hers to which 
she attached no particular significance It was his senti- 
ment, she thought at first, remembering him as he had 
been It was a habit among Germans, a form of courtesy, 
to pretend that a woman who picked a flower for them gave 
them the world, and Rupert had always been a German 
of the old school But the truth, she perceived, was deeper 
than this shallow explanation of it, there was no formal 
pretence underlying Rupert’s emotion, nor did it suffice 
to say that, being an invalid and a man who loved her, he 
was naturally made glad by any kindness of hers It was 
not gratitude that moved him, not a sick man’s pathetic 
dependence, nor was it love, as she had formerly under- 
stood his love No man could be more independent than 
he To all who came near him m the Castle he was charm- 
ing and gentle and courteous, but he was separated from 
them as though he and they inhabited different planes of 
existence In the same way, he was separated from the 
war Though he asked for bulletins and studied them with 
great maps pinned to a table, he made no comment and 
seemed to be engrossed in a historian’s narrative, not m a 
campaign that had power over his own destiny Only 
from Julie was he not separated and, in his imagination, 

inseparable , 

When she went out to the place where he would sit and 
gaze over the lakes, he seemed scarcely to know that she 
had been absent from him Was he lonely^ she asked Had

she left him too long alone? “But you are always here,” he 
answered “You are the lakes and their quietness, you are 
the sun and its warmth, you are the spring, and the 
summer that’s coming You are my last throw, my Julie, 
on the table of this world The past and the future are 
included in it ” 

“Your last throw? Why do you say that?” 

“But for you, I should play no more ” 

“You mean you would die? But why should you ” 

“No, my dear, I’m not trying to frighten you with the 
heroics of suicide,” he said, “though suicide is a journey 
like another which reasonable men are entitled to make 
I mean only that to all else but you I am already dead — 
or shall be when I am fully master of myself I know that, 
except m you, the world can give me nothing comparable 
with what I have lost, and a world that has nothing to give 
has nothing to take away I am a German and a landowner 
After this war, my land may still be mine and hold its 
value — perhaps the only thing that will hold its value 
But the greater part of my wealth not m land will vanish 
if we are beaten If I die, there will be nothing for you, the 
land will stay m my family, there will be nothing else 
And if I live — the whole tradition is gone, or so I believe 
In generations, we may build it up again The Prussian 
ideal will prevail at last because it is necessary to civiliza- 
tion But meanwhile ” He moved his hand towards 

her “I shall see nothing of it Only greed and indiscipline 
and selfishness and the throttling of the best by the many 
that is called democracy Why should I share m it or have 
any part m it? I believe m nothing but that it will some day 
be superseded, when the world has learned at last what 
Prussia tned to enforce too soon I would work and fight 
against it if I had my strength and my friends were living, 
but I have none and they are dead But you are alive, 
Julie, and in you, perhaps, my children and their children ” 
“Who are to be revenged on England?” she said 
“To be revenged? O Julie, I have made nothing clear 
It is not of England or France or Germany I am thmkmg 
Not of this war or another, they are all put away from me

But of an aristocracy of mankind that has the will and 
courage to rule, to breed a tradition and preserve it 
Revenge on England? I do not think m those terms The 
flower of the two great peoples of the world have choked 
e ach other, that is all We shall pay for it The great peoples 
will be ruled by their own degenerates But some day, if 
avalization does not perish, the world will begin to think 
again 

“You revive old heats in me that I thought I had out- 
grown,” he added after a pause in which he looked 
attentively into her face “I don’t wish as long as I live 
ever to feel hatred or anger again Read to me ” 

“The newspaper?” 

“No, not the newspaper You can’t read Goethe?” 

She smiled “You never liked my German verse ” 

“Prose then Let’s have a book, a long book, that you 
aliall read to me when you have time, little by little Shall 
it be Wilhelm Meister?” 

“But it isn’t a good book to read aloud,” she said, 
“particularly to one who knows it as you do If you were 
reading to yourself you would pass over yards of it, but 
if I am reading you will sit there listening ” 

“To your voice, Julie You don’t understand You will 
never understand You think of yourself as a girl like

broke off, then continued with fanatical intensity “But

You hold all that the world has spilled— you have it in the

philosophy They are no more changed by the circum- 
stances in which we read them than a lake is changed by

the moving images of ourselves that we perceive in it The 

Odyssey is such a book, the Phaedo is another ” 

“The Odyssey 1 the Phaedo 1 ” she exclaimed, and, when 
he asked her why she had been astonished, she could 
answer only that she had not been astonished by his choice, 

but that it had reminded her 

“Of what, Julie? Do you love the books so much? I 
haven’t heard that ring of wonder m your voice since — I 
think I have never heard it until now,” he added musingly 
“I read the Odyssey when I was a child,” she said 
“It was that, I expect, the old memory ” 

“In Greek? Were you a scholar of Greek as well as of 
Latin?” 

She hesitated before answering that she had learned a 
little Greek, but that for the most part it had been trans- 
lated — 

“Ah 1 I remember,” he said “By the Englishman who 
was a prisoner here Is he still in Enkendaal?” 

“In Kerstholt’s cottage ” 

“Alone?” 

“There were two others with him He’s alone now 99 
“Alone by choice?” 

Julie nodded “What you said just now — to be still, 
listening — that is what he is after He calls it the stillness 
of an axis at the centre of a wheel ” 

“I understand that,” Narwitz said “It is a good meta- 
phor The axis that moves forward with the wheel but 
never revolves It is a beautiful metaphor . Why does 
he not come here?” 

“How can he, Rupert?” 

“Because he and I are enemies?” 

“You are officers at war ” 

“You mean, he would not meet me?” 

Again Julie hesitated “He wouldn’t refuse,” she said 
“Then? Julie, my dear, he and I are not enemies 
I am not the enemy of such men Ask him to come He is 
a scholar He has a mind and a tradition You like him?” 
“Yes ” 

“Ask him to meet me then ”

Julie did not answer She had not visited Lewis in the 
cottage, perhaps, if he were to see her husband, he would 
know why it had been impossible that she should go, and 
m what way, beyond her expectation, she was bound by 
Rupert’s imagining of her 

“What book shall I read to you?” she asked “I will 
bring it from the library ” 

“He worked in the library, didn’t he?” 

“Who?” 

Narwitz sought for the name “Alison You said in a 
letter ” 

“Yes But his work there is finished ” 

She thought that he was listening for the tones of her 
voice, but he said “I know the book — Turgemev’s On 
the Eve That is an absolute book I read it last in Vienna 
before we were married Read me that ” 

“In German? There is no German translation here ” 

“In French then,” he said “Or in your own language 
Let it be to-morrow And when I wake m the night, or if 
I can’t sleep, I shall say To-morrow Julie will read 
Turgemev to me, and I shall hear your voice and see your 
head bent over the page ” 



CHAPTER THREE 

Next morning Julie went down to the Enkendaal post- 
office with the possibility, perhaps the intention, m her 
mind of going afterwards to the cottage If she had met 
Allard or another walking up the hill towards the moor, 
she might have gone with him, and, reaching the lane that 
led to Kerstholt’s gate, turned into it, if she had met Lewis, 
she might have said “Rupert wants to see you Come to 
the Castle and meet him ” But when she came out of the 
little shop, she was alone, the avenue, from which the last 
few days had withdrawn the freshness of spring, was 
empty and still She gazed down the great aisle, barred 
with May sunshine, and thought how exciting it would be 
to stand like Samson between two trees and break them 
Then she returned by the Castle lodge and the avenue 
that skirted the first lake Rupert was m his accustomed 
place She felt that it was cruel to stand and watch him 
as though he were a stranger She might almost love him 
if she could but confess, if she could break his eternal 
repose by leaning over the back of his chair and whisper- 
ing that 

Instead she seated herself beside him and began to read 
Turgemev, but her thought was not m the story Its distant 
melancholy came to her as the throbbing of str ing ed music 
comes m the night to one who lies awake far from the 
violins Her own mind, beset by intuitions of loss and 
peril, tossed m wakeful fever between remembrances of 
her love and an eagerness to fulfil her husband’s imagining 
of her Looking up from the book, she saw that Rupert 
was in pam, the compression of his mouth was her evid-

ence, but his eyes were calm as the lake itself and she 
wondered whether it was indeed possible, while suffering 
bodily pain, to remain altogether aloof from it Her heart 
leapt in admiration of this self-mastery, which was more 
than courage, but from admiration she fell back into a 
cold, separated awe 

While continuing to read, she wondered when, and m 
what circumstances, she would meet Lewis again Every 
day that passed would give to their meeting, when it came, 
an added emphasis of intervening silence How, when 
they met, should she explain that her silence — but there 
would be no need of explanation Lewis would perceive 
that not failure of her love, but a growth of herself, had 
withheld her, and that the desperate mood m which it had 
seemed natural and easy that she should pursue her love 
m secret was fallen into her past She remembered Lewis’s 
power of discovering aspects of herself which she did not 
at first believe m but was afterwards compelled to re- 
cognize, and, laying down the book, she said “ Rupert, 
how does one distinguish between what the mind per- 
ceives and what it creates? I mean ” She heard him 

struggling to answer her and raised her head swiftly, in 
alarm She sprang up, so terrible a change had been 
worked m him that she, who knew nothing of death, 
supposed him to be dying His face was twisted and 
charged with blood as though there were a cord at his 
throat, his eyes were swollen and staring, the intervals 
between his breathing were so long that during them it 
seemed impossible that he should ever breathe again 
She would have run for the nurse, but he seized her hand, 
held it, would not have her go, and while the attack en- 
dured he held her fast Through his struggles, she saw 
the lake and the great drum of the tower and the sky 
where no cloud moved, even when she was on her knees 
beside him m helpless anguish, filled with an obscure 
shame for the ease of her own body, the fantastic quietness 
of the scene lapped at the edges of her mind as a still sea 
laps at a ship blazing 

His breathing eased at last He lay with head thrown

back, drawing m the unspeakable luxury of breath and 
expelling it with little vibrant sighs 

“You give me more strength than their remedies,” he 
said “I didn’t know ” 

The abruptness with which he let fall her hand warned 
her that the release had not been voluntary His fingers 
had lost their grip, his body had slackened and fallen loose, 
a pallor, stained at the lips and nostrils with dull purple, 
grew m his face, and Julie, supporting him, began to cry 
for help She could not be heard, nothing answered her 
but a puppy, yapping in the sunshine, nothing moved but 
the spiral smoke of a chimney-stack until by chance the 
nurse came down the verandah steps and began to throw 
pebbles to the puppy Julie continued to cry out The 
woman turned her head, stared, shaded her dazzled eyes, 
and came lumbering across the gravel with the puppy 
dancing at her heels 

For a night and the greater part of a day, Rupert lay 
m exhaustion, his features visited by the shrunken refine- 
ment and the tranquillitv of death The doctor, who 
knew him less well than the nurse, feared that he might 
die, but Rupert gazed up at him with a silent challenge 
that caused him to say when out of his patient’s hear- 
ing “There’s death in his body, but he has life in his 
eyes ” 

“If he hadn’t something to live for,” the nurse answered, 
“he might be dead in an hour ” 

“And what has he to live for? Precious little that I can 
see ” 

“His wife ” 

The doctor was coaxing the lock of a small bag that he 
had propped on the banisters “Och* An affectionate 
couple then,” he said with a chuckle, and the nurse, be- 
ginning to explain, checked herself and shrugged her 
shoulders Juke was walking towards them down the pass- 
age 

The doctor shook a playful, encouraging finger at her, 
wishing to show the nurse that he was at ease among these 



ch hi THE BOND 301 

aristocrats “D’you know, it’s you he needs, Mevrouw, 
more than me ’ 

He was disconcerted when Julie answered, “Yes, I 
know,” and for his own consolation, more than for hers, 
he patted her shoulder She smiled and withdrew, entering 
the bedroom ’ s 

“English,” he said, knowingly, and the nurse, making 
a funnel of her lips and cocking her head, drew in breath 
with a hrs that committed her to nothing 

When Rupert had gathered strength enough to leave his 
bedroom and sit in the verandah, he remembered the Eng- 
lishman Now that the attack is over, Julie will bring him 
here, he thought First we shall talk of subjects that have 
no nationality, that will be easy enough, unless he’s a fool, 
but when we begin to speak of the war or the destiny of 
peoples — then we shall have our work cut out Not to keep 
our tempers — we are not savages, but to speak our minds, 
to break down polite barriers, to go, as German and Eng- 
lishman, to the heart of our subject ° 

He wondered what Alison was like, Julie, v hose letters 
had a caricaturist’s trick of suggesting a likeness m some 
extravagant phrase, had never described him He would 
ask her when she came, meanwhile, Sophie or the Baroness 
would tell him, and he opened his lips to ask But, looking 
at the two women, he hesitated, their silence w as pleasanter 
than their speech which, once begun, would not easily be 
checked They were seated in wicker chairs to his left and 
nght The elder had a frame of drawn-thread work lying 
on her knee, but her needle had long been inactive, she 
was gazing at the verandah railings with the dulled unsee- 
ing eye of a passenger m a waiting-room The younger 
had before her an open book of which she turned a page 
now and then, once, Rupert thought, she turned two pages 
without noticing it, she was not reading with continuing 
interest — perhaps not reading at all 

Only when Julie was not with him did Sophie come, 
only when Sophie came did the Baroness appear, inevitable 
as a shadow Now for the first time he perceived that there

was system and connected motive m their coming and go- 
ing In his presence they were on guard over each other, 
though they seldom exchanged a glance or a word, and, 
looking suddenly into Sophie’s mind, he said What is it 
that she wishes to tell me but dare not? What is it that the 
Baroness is determined that she shall not tell? He wondered 
if there was m Sophie a cabined unhappiness for which 
she sought relief, and though there was something com- 
placent, almost exultant, m her manner that did not invite 
sympathy, he was sorry for her When she and he were 
alone, she was talkative m vague, timid approaches, skirt- 
ing the subject, whatever it was, that lay upon her mind, 
but when the Baroness appeared, she fell into a resigned 
and stubborn silence, sitting hunched in her chair, her knees 
pressed together, a book balanced on them, her fingers 
plucking at it The Baroness made no more than a formal 
pretence of being occupied m her sewing Sometimes she 
spoke to him, but it was of Sophie that she was thinking 
“Tell me,” he said now, “what does the Englishman 
look like?” 

“The Englishman?” the Baroness answered as though 
she did not understand 

But Sophie understood Her slack body became animate 
Her book closed on her finger “Mr Alison,” she said, “he 
is — he is — oh, dark and tall ” 

What a spray of hatred sprang from those little words, 
deliberately commonplace 1 
“That tells me little,” he said and waited 
She swallowed and wetted her tongue “Have you ever 
seen those statues,” she went on, “those statues cut out 
of wood — French, fifteenth century? Flat cheeks, ridged 
bones, deep eyes m deep pits so that often you scarcely 
know whether they’re shut or open A long neck, long 

hands and ” 

“And what?” 

“Brown, too — like wood,” she said 
“Sophie*” the Baroness put m “Don’t be fantastic 
He’s a very ordinary Englishman A publisher of some 
sort Why do you ask, Rupert?”

“I should like to see him ” 

“Yes, yes,” Sophie cried “Do see him He’d come if 
Julie asked him ” She sprang from her chair, letting her 
book slide to the ground and he unheeded “He and Julie 
were such friends But since you came, they haven’t seen 
each other Not as far as I know, at any rate ” 

The Baroness, too, stirred m her repose “It is very 
natural An Englishman and a German— here' Of course 
it’s impossible ” 

“But he is m EnkendaaP” Rupert said 
“He was living in the Castle, working at some papers 
in the library,” she replied with the air of one cautiously 
opening a long and difficult narrative “When we heard 
you were coming, he went— very rightly No doubt he will 
soon leave the cottage too Meanwhile, he won’t trouble 
you He is very proud, very English If we asked him here 
now ” 

“If Julie asked him he would come You know he 
would'” Sophie exclaimed 

The Baroness disiegarded her “You need quiet, 
Rupert Not quarrels and excitements Not to be reminded 
of things best forgotten ” 

“But you would not object to his coming' 1 ” 

“Object? Why, no Certainly not, but ” 

“Ella hates him,” Sophie cried “She’s afraid of him 
She ” 

"Afraid? Who is afraid' 1 ” It was Julie’s voice behind 
his chair He stretched out his hand to her 
“I don’t know, my dear,” he answered “We were 
talking of Alison I’m afraid your mother doesn’t wish 
him to come here ” 

“I have no kind of objection,” the Baroness replied in 
a tone of sweetened anger “Why should I have? I was 
thinking of you, Rupert It will be impossible for you to 

meet an Englishman who ” 

“Is a student of Plato?” 

“Plato or no Plato, he’s your enemy ” Her tongue 
began to run away with her “He knows as well as you do 
that now, after Ludendorff’s failure, it is only a question

of time before A meeting could not be comfortable 
for you or for him ” 

“Ludendorff’s failure,” Julie repeated “Is that final, 
Rupert?” 

“It is not the end,” he answered “We shall struggle 
on to back the diplomatists and try to save face But, m 
a military sense, it is final No one who has been lately m 
Germany can doubt it ” He spoke with regulated calm 
as though of some profound emotion belonging to the 
past “But am I for that reason to be shut off from this 
man? We may be of the more value to each other ” 

“He would come if you asked him,” Sophie said, looking 
at the ground, and Julie replied swiftly “Yes, I don’t 
think for a moment he’d refuse Shall I ask him, mother?” 

“Certainly, if Rupert wishes it ” 

He knew that the Baroness’s consent had been wrung 
from her, he perceived the dry smile at the corners of 
Sophie’s mouth, the tension between them was not to be 
mistaken Julie would explain to him, and when they had 
withdrawn — as they always withdrew when she found 
him — he raised his eyebrows and asked what was the 
mystery? “Mystery?” she said, and, when he told her how 
her mother and Sophie had done battle, she shook her 
head, saying that he must have imagined it “Imagined 1 ” 
he exclaimed “Didn’t you see Sophie’s face?” But Julie 
had taken up the Turgemev from the table at his side 
“How far had we read before your attack?” she asked, 
sliding her fingers between the leaves, but when she had 
begun to read he found himself searching her expression 
as though he suspected her of concealments, and she 
had read several pages before his reason quieted him 
with the thought But naturally she would not wish to 
insist upon differences between her mother and the 
Leydens 

“Julie,” he said, interrupting her sentence so abruptly 
that her eyes came up to him in protest and her lips re- 
mained parted, “this thing — whatever it is — between your 
mother and Sophie — it’s nothing serious?” 

“They have never liked each other ”

He nodded “Nothing fresh, then— nothing to make 
you unhappy?” 

“Nothing ” 

“That’s all I wanted to know ” 

She moved her face abruptly away from him as though 
she were afraid that tears would spring into her eyes, then 
returned, smiling a wry, tender smile, and, with the 
generous ardour of a schoolgirl, very different from her 
smile m its quality and significance, took his hand im- 
pulsively between hers As if she were a younger sister, 
he thought 

“You are good to me, Rupert ” 

“I love you, my dear ” 

“So much? It must need the charity of the gods to 
love me as you do ” 

“No,” he answered, “my love is not at all godlike, 
Julie It is the love of a man for a woman Though I have 
been an invalid, it is that still Often I think Perhaps the 
time is near when I shall hold you and see you as I used 
to see you And forget that bodies are grotesque, poisoned, 
festering things And have children — who knows?” 

She had released his hand She was rigid beside him, 
her teeth pressing her lip, her breath held 

“That frightens you?” he said 

“No ” 

“But m that way you do not love me?” 

“Oh Rupert Perhaps it matters less than I think 
And will change Before, years ago, I wasn’t awake I 

couldn’t be Now ” She added with an agonized 

eagerness in her voice, ruling herself, persuading herself 
“In the past, I know, though you were gentle and patient, 
sometimes I refused you I will never refuse you now Do 
you understand, Rupert, that whatever I say, whatever I 
seem to fear, even if in some kind of madness I can’t con- 
trol I seem to hesitate, shrink — I’m yours And it won’t 
be sacrifice or duty — never think that I shall never wish 
to refuse you again Be at peace, my dear, you shall 
have all the peace I can give It is yours already Yours 
finally”

But while she spoke, tears filled her eyes and began to 
flow down her cheeks, denying all her will 

“Where is the place?” she said “Let’s read,” and she 
stumbled into the scene in which Bersenyev describes 
Insarov to Elena When she had read a few sentences, a 
single, uncontrollable sob took speech from her She was 
silent and ashamed 

“It will all come right,” she managed to stammer out 
“It shall It shall, Rupert I promise Don’t despise me ” 

“I have never despised you less or loved you more,” he 
replied 

For answer, she hid her face m her hands She was 
not weeping, her shoulders were still Soon she took the 
book again and, without looking up, began to read — very 
quietly at first, then with natural liveliness 



CHAPTER FOUR 

On the day after his return to the cottage, Lewis had 
walked on to the moors by a path through Kerstholt’s 
garden It led him across two rising meadows to a belt of 
pine trees beyond which the country opened out into a 
vast, undulating tableland Afterwards he chose this way 
always, for it touched none of the approaches to the Castle 
From one edge of the tableland he could look down on 
to Rynwyk, with its river stretched across it m the haze 
like a ribbon of watered silk, from the other, the Castle 
lakes were visible, gleaming among the valley woods, and 
a wide circuit over high ground would take him in the 
direction of the Huis ten Rorgh 

He chose to go out at dawn or m the evening dusk and 
to keep the house by day, for Julie, if she came, would 
come m the daytime Often, while reading in the upper 
room, he imagined that she was on her way to him and 
listened for her footsteps But the silence continued, she 
did not come, and returning to his book he would be lost 
m it and look up after many hours to realize with wonder, 
even with a sense of betrayal and loss, that for thus long 
his mind had been emptied of her The images of her 
beauty would break m upon him as though music flooded 
through a silent house, but would recede at last, leaving 
him his own stillness 

Sometimes all his being was held m stress by Julie’s 
silence and by his imaginings of her life separated from 
his, sometimes this tension of personal longing was super- 
seded by the higher tension of solitude, that tuning of the 
mind to perceptions beyond common range which, at

once terrible and full of delight, enables men to transcend 
for a little while their loves and fears on earth 

Once he wrote, asking news of her “Nothing is as 1 
thought it would be,” she answered in a letter that bore 
the postmark, not of Enkendaal, but of Rynwyk “I can’t 
explain now Wait until I can tell you Meanwhile, don’t 
come here, Lewis But, my dearest, don’t go away ” She 
had repeated the command and underlined it “Don't go 
away I’ll make everything clear soon ” He crushed the 
letter in his hand and started up Though night was falling, 
he would go to the Castle at once The need to cut through 
her wavering contradictions to some finality, some endur- 
ing peace, inflamed him He set out, but, as he went, the 
vanity of his own wrath appeared to him, he hesitated, 
and stood beside the lakes, gazing at the lighted windows 
of the Castle 

Dread and longing, he thought, are identified in love, 
and, turning from the glow of light, he saw the trees on the 
hill behind him lay their quiet branches against the sky 
They reminded him of the elms in the fort, as he had so 
often seen them, through the open window of his dormi- 
tory, when all but he were sleeping, and he perceived a 
profound continuity between that happy isolation and his 
present solitudes in the cottage His hand touched a letter 
in his pocket, not Julie’s but his mother’s, and he remem- 
bered the letters that she had written when his internment 
began Then and now she w 7 rote m the same tone, eagerly 
recalling him to the world Mr Ford had died early m 
April, and she wrote continually to complain of his death, 
it seemed to her the crown of his neglect of the firm that 
he should have died at this time His trustees, as far as they 
were able, would withdraw his capital, the firm, weakened 
by him m his life, would be deeply impoverished “Per- 
haps beyond all hope of recovery,” Mrs Alison wrote, 
“unless you ask the Dutch for parole and come to England 
at once ” She was deliberately an alarmist, but Lewis 
knew from figures he had already received that the work 
of ten years was to be done again His mother assumed 
that it was worth doing and that he would do it, his

suggestion that after the war the publishing house might 
be sold and she and Janet live on the proceeds was resisted 
by her with all the persuasions of sentiment “ Remember,” 
she said, “that if ever you have a son, you can leave him 
nothing so valuable as a flourishing business ” 

Lewis smiled, remembering her vehemence Perhaps it 
would m the end become inevitable that he should return 
to Alison and Ford, but he did not now deeply consider 
the future He knew onlv that to choose between one 
routine of existence and another was not to choose life 
itself Life, he thought, as he walked up the road among 
the trees, does not consist in outward acts and is little 
affected by them It is an inward and secret experience 
which those who become aware of it — and they are few 
except in childhood and perhaps m great age — seek to 
intensify, for to intensify is to protect and sustain it In 
this encircled consciousness, on this secluded ground, 
wisdom flowers from the seed of the mysteries, of which 
the most fruitful are love and death Here they yield their 
immortal fruit, but in the field of action, which men call 
life, they yield only pleasure and fear, emotions that perish 
Therefore they who dwell in the outer field, aware in a 
sick distress that though they seem to live they are not 
immortally alive, seek always to drive contemplative spirits 
to corruptible action and emotion, using every ins tr um ent 
of pnde and desire to goad or allure them And as men 
are thus divided into those who would live inwardly and 
those who, in the name of action, are the enemies of life, 
so each man is divided against himself, being of the flesh 
as well as of the spirit, and his desires cry m his silences, 
calling him to betray his own citadel 
His desires cry m his silences, Lewis repeated, remem- 
bering with what heat he himself had set out into the 
night In the upper room of the cottage Julie’s letter was 
lying on the floor, crumpled, as it had fallen from his 
hand He picked it up and gazed at it under the lamp, feel- 
ing now neither resentment nor hunger It was as though 
the wind had dropped in his soul and she were the calm 
succeeding it

Owls hooted m the wood above the cottage While first 
reading her letter, he had been aware neither of their 
melancholy complaint nor of the intervening silences 
Now the anger that had been a storm within him was an 
anger recorded in a tale and, spreading his books under 
the lamp, he was flooded with the joy of integrity re- 
covered, the delight of one who wakes from a thwarted 
dream into the power and freedom of daylight 

So day by day he withdrew within the circles of con- 
sciousness towards the centre of his being, little disturbed 
even by the knowledge that the solitude of his present life 
could not endure Nights of dreamless sleep were followed 
by the vigour of the morning, given always to new work, 
for his history moved forward now, swift and smooth In 
the afternoons he revised old pages, allowing an interval 
of several days to pass between writing and revision, and 
m the evenings, among his books or on foot across the 
moors, he allowed other men’s genius or his own experi- 
ence to flow in upon him, not compelling himself to learn 
from them purposefully or in a way prescribed, but happy 
that they should teach him as they would, like wise 
travellers encountered fortunately who walked with him 
a little while until their road parted from his 

Beneath his happiness m this seclusion was the know- 
ledge and memory of a different bliss, present m his mind 
like the sound of a sea from which he was moving away, 
and as one who dwells long inland remembers at last not 
the turbulence of waters, their fret and change, but only 
their rhythm, their everlasting force and splendour, so 
his thought of Julie was coloured always by those qualities 
m her that were enduring and beautiful The representa- 
tion of love as a movement through hunger towards 
satiety and indifference, he perceived now, m his own 
experience, to be false It was possible to love m peace, 
to desire, and remember desire, without the jealousy of 
possession 

The thought of Julie rose continually within him, but 
as an endorsement of his tranquillity Its warmth was the 
warmth of the sun, a source of energy and natural delight,

not of a flame, edged, biting, uncertain, and as at night 
he would pass through dreams of her into that whiteness 
of spirit from which remembrance of this life is abstracted, 
so by day his vision of her would fade, not into forget- 
fulness, not into love’s death, but into a dreamless suspense 
of its aching and travail 

By such a mood was he enwrapped when, coming down- 
stairs one morning, he found on a table a letter from Julie 
It had not been there when he went to the upper room on 
the previous evening His Dutch servant could tell him 
nothing of how it came, there had been no messengers, and 
Lewis remembered that the windows on to the verandah 
had stood open all night Thus Julie had entered and gone 
A few hours ago, in the darkness, she had been in this 
room, laying down this letter, secretly, with what expres- 
sion of fear, of adventure, of excitement on her face? 

Lewis dear, 

Rupert has asked to see you I was afraid at first — 
not of him but of seeing you again But he has set his mind 
on it So have I — now I will tell you why, some day Please

Julie 

He could think only that she had been m this room 
where he now stood, that her hand had lain on the paper 
he was touching Afterwards she had gone down the gravel 
slope towards the gate, looking back, perhaps, to his lighted 
window above her, and had returned to her husband For 
the first time he struggled for an image of this man who 
claimed and possessed her, and everything before his eyes 
was agitated and transformed by the struggle Even the 
wooden table had a bleak, angry gleam Silence and isola- 
tion became suddenly intolerable, and his work so distaste- 
ful that, when he went upstairs and seated himself at his 
table, striving to pick up again the thread of his argument, 
the quiet sentences he had written had a mocking sound 
m them as though they were not his own but the composi- 
tion of some satirical writer aping him His pen lay idle

at his side and when a gust of wind scattered his papers 
he did not move It reminded him of how on the ramparts 
of the fort the wind would bluster in the pages of his book 
and rip them from beneath his finger The fort is empty 
now, he thought, the barbed wire is dangling from the 
poles, but every evening the children on the opposite 
bank turn to watch the tram as it passes and wave their 
caps Soon this room, also, will be empty I shall be on my 
way to the Castle When I return to sleep here to-night, 
I shall be entering a strange house It is already strange to 
me, he added, raising his head, as strange as the fort 
would be if I went back to it 



CHAPTER FIVE 

The breeze that disturbed his papers had fallen when 
Lewis went out of the cottage, even the cord of the veran- 
dah-blind did not sway or tremble, so heavy was the air 
As he walked down the hill towards the Castle, no shadow 
moved but his own, and the lakes had the appearance of 
being covered by a glistening film At the gates he paused, 
reluctant to enter, and, as Julie had done nearly a week 
earlier, he looked down the great avenue that stretched 
from Enkendaal towards the main road into Rynwyk The 
regularity of these elms and of their diminishing intervals 
of sunshine, their soaring strength wearing anew the quick 
green of early summer, which had taunted her by an aloof 
and imperturbable repose, delighted him, and he turned 
away with regret, for he saw in the endurance and renewals 
of Nature and her superb independence of men's passions, 
not a threat or contemptuous challenge to the shortness of 
human life but a pattern of what man might aspire to be- 
come To go into the Castle grounds and accept Julie's 
summons was, he knew, to abandon an inward security 
that was precious to him, but to go back would be to shrink 
from life m a pretence of transcending it, and he went 
forward 

His heart quickened at the thought that soon he and 
Julie would be face to face The lapse of time would have 
taken away the ease of their association and each would 
search the other with an almost sensual curiosity, surprised, 
a little embarrassed even, by seeing m the flesh the com- 
panion of an intimacy that was already becoming a remem- 
bered, rather than an actual, delight, and he, shaken by

her beauty, would begin to think his old thought, that there 
was something arbitrary and fantastic — as though Oberon 
had squeezed juices on her eyes — in her bodily love for 
him He remembered how, m the past, this thought had 
been the subtlest of his pleasures, preserving always a 
miraculous element m their love so that each evidence of 
her passion, each rapture of her breath and movement, was 
to him a fresh wonder never finally credible or established 
in his mind as a thing known and accepted It had evoked 
in him a sensation of brilliant impermanence, not of pos- 
sessive and personal right, and there arose within him now, 
not physical jealousy of her husband but a profound re- 
pudiation of the being by whom a personal right m her was 
assumed The idea of marriage, of exclusive and enduring 
possession, had never been a part of his own and Julie’s 
love, it had been of the essence of their life together that 
this idea was excluded from it, and now its entry m the 
person of Narwitz worked m Lewis’s mind like a sudden 
poison, calling up a succession of brutal and sensual images 
so loathsome to him and contrary to the natural organiza- 
tion of his mind that his thought violently rejected them, 
spued them out as the body also vomits a poison For an 
instant his consciousness was blank, and when, emerging 
from bewilderment, he saw that he was still walking under 
the shadow of the trees at the edge of the first lake, his 
memoiy, thrusting aside what was unendurable to it, pre- 
sented von Narwitz to him as a name only, an idea without 
association, and his thought was confused and puzzled by 
it as by some indeterminate terror surviving from a dream 
In this moment during which, for him, Narwitz had only 
a shadowy unreal existence, he saw on the grassy bank at 
the edge of the drive the man himself, who turned his head 
and stretched out a delaying hand and spoke 

“You must be Mr Alison I have long hoped to see you ” 

“Yes, I am Alison ” 

“I am Narwitz You will forgive my not rising to 
welcome you? It is hard for me to move quickly when I 
have been long m one position ” 

Lewis said m a low voice that he must not attempt to

move, then was silent, even this formal courtesy having 
required of him an effort of will, but Narwitz seemed un- 
aware of constraint between them 

“That chair is Julie’s,” he said quietly “Take it for a 
little while Soon she will be coming out to read Turgeniev 
to me ” And he added, when Lewis had taken the chair 
“She says that you have been working on Dirk van 
Leyden’s papers Tell me of them I have always been 
curious about that old man ” 

Though Lewis told him of Dirk’s papers, and they fell 
into argument on subjects arising from them, his impres- 
sion of Narwitz was at first less of his words than of his 
eyes and of the extreme frailty of the face m which they 
were set It seemed that this was not a man met for the 
first time, but another long known to him whom he ought 
to recognize but could not, and, struggling for a key to this 
mysterious familiarity, he gazed at his companion with 
deepening intensity until at last Narwitz broke their dis- 
cussion to say “What is the question you are trying to 
answer m my face?” and Lewis apologized for having 
s t ar ed 

“No, no,” Narwitz answered “You were looking at me 
m a way one does not resent— not in empty curiosity but 
as if the answer to your question, whatever it is, would 
be of some genuine value to yourself ” 

“The question? I suppose I was asking myself Where 
on earth have I met that man before?” Lewis said “Of 
course we have never met, I know that But I feel that 
the few minutes we have spent together are— are like a 
little island sticking up out of the water You see an island 
floating on the surface and you say, There’s an island, as 
if that were all Then you remember that it’s only a frag- 
ment, the topmost peak exposed by chance, of a vast sea- 
mountain, perhaps of a range of mountains rooted in the 
ocean depths ” 

“Or rooted m yourself,” Narwitz interrupted, throwing 
out a keenly interrogative glance “Perhaps what makes 
me seem deeply familiar to you is that we have one pro- 
found interest m common^ Isn’t it so^” 



THE FOUNTAIN 


v 


316 

An interest in common^ For a moment, thinking of 
Julie, Lewis recoiled before the possibility of her husband’s 
suspicion, but Narwitz’s expression was gentle and calm 

“I mean,” he added, “our desire so to control our lives 
that we are invulnerable within the world That is, cer- 
tainly, a universal desire, but you and I are conscious of 
it, and that’s rare, it’s a link between us Contemplation 
is one of the words that unite men m Turgemev’s sense,” 
he added, after pausing to pick up from a small table at 
his side the book that Julie was to read to him when she 
came “Do you know this story?” He raised it m the 
sunlight 

“Yes, I know it well ” 

“In the opening — and there isn’t a lovelier opening to 
any story, it’s the character of Insarov, when he comes, 
that prevents it from being a masterpiece — m the openmg, 
when the two young men, the philosopher and the artist, 
are lying m the shade of the lime tree on the river-bank, 
discussing ants and beetles and beauty and women and 
love, do you remember how Bersenyev declares that 
happiness isn’t one of the words that unite men? The 
words that unite are Art, Country, Science, Freedom — so 
he says, it seems a strange choice to us, over-coloured with 
liberal optimism Still, Bersenyev was young Then 
he says that love, too, is a word that unites — not the love 
that Shubin has in his mind, but the love that is self- 
sacrifice ” 

“That’s a bad phrase,” Lewis interrupted 

Narwitz considered it, lifting his eyebrows and lowering 
them, as though he were tasting a wine “Yes,” he ad- 
mitted, “smudged Nineteenth-century liberalism again, 
even Turgemev couldn’t escape it ” He laughed “No 
wonder Shubin answers ‘That’s all very well for Ger- 
mans*’ ” 

“If I remember, Shubin had French blood m him,” 
Lewis said, smiling 

Narwitz’s eyes sparkled “Yes You are right Shubm 
wants love for himself He wants to be first Then, sud- 
denly — and this is what I’ve been leading to — suddenly

Turgemev writes his autobiography, or rather his explana- 
tion of himself, his apologia , m a phrase of Bersenyev’s — 
‘it seems to me that to put oneself in the second place is 
the whole significance of life ’ When Turgemev wrote 
that, love was m the foreground of his thought, it was of 
love Bersenyev had been speaking, but the saying is a 
universal one — or so I understand it,” Narwitz added, 
gazing before him Slowly he turned his eyes on Lewis 
and awaited his answer But Lewis could not answer at 
once He felt that he had been engaged m this dialogue 
before, long ago — perhaps m his own mind— and his 
reply, when he spoke it, seemed to have been given him 
by some prompter whom he was powerless to disregard 

“It seems to me that to discover what to put before 
oneself, m the first place, is the whole problem of life,” he 
said 

“It seems so to you now So it did to me — for years 
But it is not a problem that any man is under compulsion 
to solve ” 

“An artist has his answer, I suppose,” Lewis continued, 
“and a saint But most of us have none We snatch at any 
answer that comes — Freedom, Country, and now, m 
Russia, Class Is there any answer that endures except 
Art and God?” 

“Death is the answer,” Narwitz said “No,” he added 
swiftly, “not in the sense m which men say stupidly that 
‘death is the answer to all things,' meaning only that they 
are tired of thought When we are young children, we 
know nothing of death Then we become aware of it, 
recognize it, fear it or conquer our fear of it, seeing it 
always objectively as somethmg outside ourselves, a final 
pit perhaps, or a pit we shall climb out of, as some believe, 
into another life But there is another stage in the know- 
ledge of death A man who ceases to regard it as something 
outside himself and, so to speak, draws it into his con- 
sciousness and assimilates die idea of it is completely 
changed He is m all truth born again He sees himself 
now m a second place absolutely — not relatively to some- 
thmg else in the first place What occupies the first place

he may, or may not, learn some day, but that is not of 
present importance The arrogance, the delusion that 
I have found it hardest to overcome,” he said, leaning 
towards Lewis as though this aided his confession, “the 
fatal delusion is our belief that we are entitled to first place 
until we have discovered m our own experience something 
that transcends us So we set up idols, our country, our 
creed, our art, our beloved one, what you will, and pour 
all our spiritual possessions into the idol’s lap We call that 
humility or love — Turgemev would call it self-sacrifice 
Except to the gods we make out of our experience or 
dreams we will not kneel down But the true saint and 
philosopher,” Narwitz concluded in a tone not of assertion 
but of longing, “is he who can kneel without an image 
because he sees himself m a second place absolutely, and 
to kneel is an inward necessity to him Fate cannot touch 
such a man — or, rather, though it rend his mind and body, 
it cannot affect him ” 

While they talked, the breeze of the early morning 
returned The still gleam of the lakes was changed into 
a sparkling ripple and Lewis felt the air move coolly on his 
forehead Among the trees on the opposite bank, the 
domed roof of the pavilion was shining m the sun, shining 
and occulting as the shadow of branches swayed over it, 
and the little waterfall streamed in brilliant froth from 
under the darkness of the bridge Life had never held a 
gayer or more delicious quietness than at this moment 
Lewis found that his mind moved strongly and at ease, as 
though he had been given new insight into whatever 
subject they discussed, he had the same pleasure in argu- 
ment with Narwitz as an artist has in a drawing which 
simplifies and declares itself before him, flowing with 
such a rhythm of inward power as he has never perceived 
m any work of his Even when speaking of his history of 
the contemplative life, Lewis found that m Narwitz’s 
presence he understood it more fully than in the past 
“The difficulty,” he said, “is to make clear the distinction 
between the inward stillness and balance which is the 
genuine purpose of contemplation and the indifference to 



CH V 


THE BOND 


3i9 


life or the fear of it which has many of the outward ap- 
pearances of contemplation, but is the product of a lazy 
or a cowardly mind ” J 

“The distinction is difficult,” Narwitz replied, “only 
because the genuine contemplative and the indifferent 
or lazy man have certain superficial actions in common, 
and it is hard for us to distinguish between men except 
m terms of their actions Ascetic forbearance may be 
a genuine discipline or a form of cowardice, and calm- 
ness m joy or suffering is easily confused by an external 
observer with insensitiveness to them So it happens that 
many suppose contemplative stillness to be a kind of 
death or suicide ‘The man isn’t alive,’ they say ‘He has 
chosen to go down into the grave before his time 9 And of 
those who shut themselves away from the world and 
mortify themselves, the saying is in part true But shutting 
away is not essential to stillness The supreme stillness is 
achieved m the open We suffer and enjoy, we fight and 
love, wm and lose, but, m the midst of it all, are still Is 
that a contradiction in terms? How can a man who de- 
lights m victory and suffers m defeat yet be still? Can you, 
m your history, make that paradox comprehensible?” 

“I can think of a childish parallel with it that everyone 
will understand,” Lewis answered with a smile “When 
we play a game, we love to wm and hate to lose, we don’t 
stand aside m cold indifference but struggle passionately 
with every energy of body and mind, yet the struggle is 
unreal, another and deeper life continues independently 
of the game, and survives it and is not affected by it ” 
Narwitz answered with a chuckle that this was a very 
English metaphor None but an Englishman would at- 
tempt to explain the contemplative ideal m terms of sport 
“Socrates wouldn’t have hesitated if it had served his 
purpose,” Lewis retorted 

“You are right,” Narwitz said gravely, “and you are a 
better scholar than I am ” 

“I am not a scholar among scholars ” 

“That matters not very much if your scholarship helps 
you to give an idea to the world and saves you from the

folly of supposing that what is old is new We are working 
over very old ground, you and I, searching for treasure 
that was currency once but has long been buried and by 
most men is forgotten The world has become so poor 
that its ancient treasures of the spirit are necessary to 
it It has formed a habit of thinking m groups, classes, 
masses, and civilization is breaking down under the burden 
of that error It is an error because masses are contrary to 
nature, they are not born, they do not die, they have no 
immortality, the poetry of human experience does not 
apply to them Birth and death are solitary, thought and 
growth are solitary, every final reality of a man's life is his 
alone, incommunicable, as soon as he ceases to be alone, 
he moves away from realities And the more he is identi- 
fied with others, the farther he moves from truth Lenin 
is aware of this He knows that the nearer any human 
association is to spiritual solitude, the more damaging it 
is to what he believes to be mass-truth Therefore the 
love of man for God or of man for woman is counter- 
revolutionary and he would destroy it It can't be de- 
stroyed When Lenin can merge two consciousnesses into 
one consciousness, when he can enable men to yield up 
their secrets which now they cannot communicate even 
to those they love, when he can break down the isolation 
of the human spirit, then he will succeed Not until then 
Men can share their possessions but not themselves That 
is the mystery and the power of love," he said, his voice 
falling again into the tone of personal confession, “it 
approaches more nearly than any other human experience 
to the impossible sharing of self Like every other sup- 
posed sharing, it is an unreality, but it is the supreme un- 
reality — the last that we recognise as unreal But it is a 
part of your game, Alison, we play it with heart and soul, 
all other gams and losses are poured into its loss or gam " 
After an interval of silence, he added “I have not learned 
how to transcend it If that too were lost, should I not, 
for all my lessons, be like an angry child who cannot 
distinguish between the unreal game that is over and the 
continuing reality?" And, having rested long m thought,

he said, with his eyes on Lewis “I don’t know why I ask 
you this It is a question I ask of myself ” 

The tone of intimacy and frankness m which these 
concluding words were spoken made upon Lewis an 
impression so deep, sudden and overpowering that he did 
not reply and was even unaware of any need to do so He 
had from the outset recognized m Narwitz an exceptional 
candour and strength, but had remained, in some degree, 
an external observer of them, admiring but with reserve, 
and asking himself, without being able to discover an 
answer, whence arose his feeling of familiarity with this 
iaa n whom he knew to be a stranger Now, with that abrupt 
and inexplicable transition with which one’s thought of 
a woman changes from “I like” to “I love,” a transition 
which makes of her a new woman and of the world a new 
world, he said within him Here is a great man, here is 
my master 1 and, looking again at Narwitz, he added almost 
with terror To betray him is to betray myself When he 
tried to recall the words that had produced this effect, 
he could remember only the confessional simplicity with 
which they had been spoken, a simplicity that had seemed 
to lay open his own as well as the speaker’s heart, and he 
was fill ed with the shame of one who receives dumbly, 
because he dare not respond, the affectionate confidence 
of a chil d upon whom he has secretly worked some great 
evil 

But Narwitz’s strength was m his capacity to transcend 
suffering, whether it gripped him now or lay in wait for 
him He was not to be pitied As well pity the tnumph of 
the Cross All values of the past were changed by being 
seen in the proportion of his spiritual stature, and, m his 
presence, Lewis ceased to blame or to defend his own 
conduct, arguments that would have been applicable if 
Julie’s husband had been a different man seeming now to 
have become irrelevant 

“That’s Julie’s step'” Narwitz said, unable to turn far 
enough m his chair to watch her approach 

At sight of Lewis she hesitated Her eyebrows went up 
for an instant and her eyes shone Then she ran forward 



THE FOUNTAIN

322 

and, leaning over her husband’s chair, placed her hands on 
his shoulders She looked over his head towards Lewis and 
exclaimed “So you have met, then 1 ” and waited 
“In a sense, we have known each other a long time,” 
Narwitz answered as though he had power to look into 
Lewis’s mind 

She would not take the chair she was offered, but curled 
herself on the grass, plucking little shreds of green and 
scattering them idly on her white dress 
“It’s good to see you again,” she said to Lewis “You 
have deserted us I didn’t dare to come to you I thought 

that when you were working ” The bantering untruth 

would not be completed, and though Lewis covered her 
hesitation with the first nonsense to enter his head they 
could not be at ease Narwitz, whose habit was to speak 
his thought without ceremony, broke m upon them 
“Do you know, Julie, that he and I have not spoken a 
word of the war?” 

“A good subject to avoid ” 

“I don’t think so Neither of us deliberately avoided it 
It was by chance we talked of other things But we shall 
talk of it, and must, unless we are to shut away a great 
part of our minds from each other, like polite old ladies 
at a party ” 

“If we talk of it,” Lewis said, “for heaven’s sake let it 
not be with ‘tolerance’ What we think, we say ” 

But Julie was nervous of the subject and led them away 
from it What she wanted to say to Lewis she did not 
know, chance and mood would decide that as they decided 
so much for her, but she wished to be alone with him, and 
to find herself now within reach of his hand but divided 
from him was to her an intolerable penance It drove her, 
in an attempt to cloak her feelings, to conversation of a 
kind that she might have held among strangers She was 
already m a highly nervous condition An hour ago she 
had gone upstairs, rung for servants and given orders that 
Rupert’s bed was to be moved out of his westward room 
into her own great bedchamber in the tower Standing 
by her dressing-table she had watched the alteration made,

forcing her mind to consideration of its detail— the avoid- 
ance of draughts, the direction of light falling from the 
embrasures At mght, she thought, I will look after him 
myself, the nurse will be within call if she is needed While 
the bed was being wheeled into position she went into her 
music-room and seated herself at her clavichord “Listen,” 
she called to the servants through the open door m the 
partition “Tell me, can you hear when I play?” “Ja 
Mevrouw ” “Clearly?” “O, ja, Mevrouw ” “That is good,’’ 
and she had returned to the bedroom and had walked 
restlessly to and fro, refusing to allow her eyes to settle on 
the screen that concealed the door leading down into the 
library She had been impatient of the servants’ presence, 
of their clumsy movements and heavy breathing as they 
lifted the furniture They went at last, looking over their 
shoulders, and left her alone, her cheeks flaming What 
would come of this change she did not know At least 
Rupert should not believe that she separated herself from 
him 

After sitting for a little while m her window-seat, for 
her limbs were shaking and she needed rest, she had gone 
down into the garden, thinking that she would find 
Rupert alone and wondering whether and in what manner 
she should tell him of the change she had made To see 
Lewis had sent a freezing thnll through her body which 
checked and confused her She had been able to overcome 
it only by running forward and saying emptily “So you 
have met, then'” 

Now, tearing the grass at Rupert’s feet, she saw him 
fold and unfold his fingers m the sun as though he were 
allowing an invisible fabnc to run between them, and 
heard him say “This is a day to be happy on ” 

She jumped up and laughed and stretched herself and, 
stooping suddenly, kissed him on the bps She had not 
before done this of her own will and knew not now why 
she did it, except that it seemed a part of the determination 
in which she had come from the tower into the garden He 
caught her hand, but she could not leave it to him and 
drew away, laughing again to cover her withdrawal As

she did so and her eyes met Lewis’s, she knew that Rupert 
had intercepted their glance And had perceived its 
significance? It was ridiculous to believe this, he had not 
a key to their minds Suddenly she was possessed by an 
impulse to kneel down and hide her face m the rug cover- 
ing his knees and to tell him the truth She imagined her- 
self behaving in this way and the contact of the woollen 
rug with her cheek 

A clock over the stables began to strike and far away m 
the village a bell was ringing 
“I must go back to the cottage,” Lewis said 
She watched him go 

"Well,” she asked, “what do you think of my English- 
man?” 



CHAPTER SIX 


The Baron’s liking for Narwitz had always been reluctant 
and a trifle surprised, for his wife had chosen Julie’s 
husband and he distrusted all her judgements He was, 
moreover, impatient of invalidism, people should live or 
die, like animals, he said, and nothing in contemporary 
legislation angered him more than its sentimental pre- 
servation of the unfit “Run a farm on the same principle 
and you’d be bankrupt m a Gouple of years ” In the 
application of his doctrine, he was pleased, with a smile, to 
be inconsistent, making an exception of women, particu- 
larly of elderly women, who were entitled to be cosseted 
m armchairs and to remember, with him, their youth As 
for the illnesses of young girls, he didn’t believe m them, 
marriage was his remedy, but because even young girls 
were feminine and therefore m his eyes privileged to have 
their follies winked at, he did not wish them to be humanely 
killed when they fell sick, they were to be shut away and 
sent flowers and books until they were sane and present- 
able again 

But invalidism m men, except in tenants of his who had 
the grace to die not of sickness but of old age, appeared to 
him as a contradiction of Nature Wiry and vigorous 
himself, with a light in his eye, a spring m his walk, and 
a seat on a horse that young men might envy, he recog- 
nized Rupert’s illness as a fact, and even the probability 
that he would not recover from it, without being able to 
overcome m himself a feeling of anger against the worn 
features so often twisted by pain, the crooked walk, the 
single, emaciated hand In spite of this, he liked Rupert 

325

and often stood beside his chair, cautiously avoiding sight 
of that hand, and told him that he would soon be better 
It was not a fruitful seed of conversation, never had there 
been an invalid less willing to talk of his health, and they 
passed on abruptly to speak of other things — of stock and 
crops, never of politics So often had he said, without 
believing it, that health would return with summer, that 
when the face became less grey, the movement more 
elastic, and even the skm of the fingers less brittle, it was 
easy for him to persuade himself that he had been a 
prophet “Always said so,” he told Julie “Getting fit is 
just a question of making up your mind You live if you 
want to live, die if you want to die ” She repeated this to 
Rupert, who said “It’s true ” 

She knew that it was true of him, and the truth 
frightened her By his will, by the working of unceasing 
miracles m his own body, he was establishing his hold on 
life because she had reappeared in it In a month he 
suffered but one attack of asthma, after which, instead of 
lying like a man m a trance for twenty-four hours, he had 
rested two hours only, then had risen and, unaided, walked 
into the sunshine like a ghost She was beginning to 
understand that his sensuous perceptions had little force 
except m association with her When she was present or 
when, in her absence, he thought of her, the flowers had 
scent and the sky colour as they had not for him at any 
other time He told her this, it was an amusing freakish- 
ness that he had observed in himself “You see,” he said, 
thinking to please her, “even Nature’s your servant ” 
And once, at the edge of the island m the upper lake to 
which he often asked her to take him, he made her stoop 
down and dip her bared arm m the water “That’s worth 
living for,” he said 

If these things had been m him a refinement of a 
passionate lover’s sensuality, she would have received 
them as she knew how to receive like refinements m other 
men, quietening them with the ease of her glance or 
turning them aside with laughter But they were m 
Rupert stages m his rediscovery of life itself She could

not interrupt them though she knew that they were leading 
to a demand which she could accept but never fulfil To 
accept all things from this man whom she did not love 
became for her a passionate vocation In concealing the 
past, she was no longer protecting herself Neither pity 
nor fear nor remorse compelled her To withhold herself 
from confession was part of her expiatory resolve 

Only at night, as she lay m bed listening to the sound of 
his breath across the room or, when he was unable to 
sleep, waiting through stiff, enduring silences for his next 
movement, only then did she have relief from her ob- 
session and allow her mind to drift away It approached 
with timidity, almost with disbelief, the rapture of her 
days and nights before his return He had seemed then to 
be unreal, and powerless to affect her illusion of encircle- 
ment Now the joys of the past, which had seemed pro- 
tected, untouchable, absolute joys, existed only as a 
prelude to expiation, and when she and Lewis were to- 
gether, Rupert stood m their thoughts like a giant by 
whose shadow their own love was changed Changed, 
made older, cast down to earth, but not destroyed, she 
said Not destroyed ? What remained but their secret and 
a profound gentleness towards each other m the sharing 
of it? Her lids began to stmg and she closed them against 
the darkness She curled her body between the sheets, 
aching for a ghost, as she imagined old people must ache 
in whom passion, but not the memory of it, was dead 
Then, as though even this thought were a denial of the 
pledge she had now given herself, she crept out of bed 
and crossed the room to Rupert’s side and kneeled there, 
staring at the gleam of his high forehead and the pits of 
his eyes 

In the mormng he remembered that she had knelt beside 
him 

His evening meal was always taken to him m the tower, 
and except on rare occasions Julie dined with him He sat 
propped on a sofa with a tray beside him on a low stool, 
she at a little table with a hand-bell on it When the meal

was done she rang the bell, and two servants, whom he 
would not have in the room and who waited therefore m 
the passage, cleared away Before going, they lowered the 
shades on the tall candles and saw that the wood-basket 
was full, for though it was past the season of fires, and m 
Holland, but not m Enkendaal, fuel was scarce, Julie would 
sometimes set a few logs blazing when Rupert was sleep- 
less To watch the flames was better than to stare into the 
dark 

At nine o’clock the nurse came to prepare him for the 
night and settle him m his bed Julie would go to her 
music-room and undress, then, putting on a silk wrap and 
loosening her hair, sit at her piano or her clavichord, wait- 
ing for the nurse’s withdrawal When the woman was gone, 
Rupert’s voice would call “What are you going to play 
to-night, Julie?” and she would play, sometimes by his 
choice, sometimes by her own She had offered to have 
the clavichord moved into the bedroom itself “No, please 
leave it,” he said “I like you to be invisible when you play 
Do you know, Julie, what gives me more pleasure than 
anything m the world? Imagine it Here I lie on my bed 
You ask me to choose music and I choose it Then, there’s 
silence Then, suddenly, the first notes — sometimes of the 
piece I chose, the music that has been waiting in my 
mind, but sometimes it’s not my choice but yours, a clash 
with my expectation, something that for an instant I don’t 
recogmze Then recognition comes, like a flood And m 
the excitement of recogmtion, the music seems to rise from 
nowhere — to flow m from no human origin, then, because 
I can’t see you, the imagination of you appears through 
the music like a face out of a stream, and when the music 
ceases I think She will come through that door I shall 
see her After all — she is alive 1 ” 

When she returned to the bedroom, she would talk to 
him a little while, often m German for he loved her to 
speak it, then stoop over him and kiss him He kissed her 
lips and her hand “Some day,” he had said once, “per- 
haps — a child — at your breast,” and had cupped her breast 
m his hand, as though he held his fate He would dose his

eyes while she was stooping over him so that her face might 
be the last thing seen before he slept, and she, leaving him 
rigid and with eyelids compressed, would go from candle 
to candle, extinguishing them 

One night when she returned from her music-room he 
was not m his bed but seated in an embrasure, looking out 
on to the lakes — the same embrasure m which she had 
awaited Lewis’s first coming He turned his head to speak, 
and she knew instantly what he would have of her A streak 
of soft terror like the fluttering of a moth’s wings ran up 
her spine, curling over the backs of her upper arms She 
felt the air swing between her body and her nightdress, 
and drew the folds taut to quell the prickled uprising 
of her flesh Then, tilting her chin, she answered him, 
with a flourish of gaiety like the waving of a flower She 
would pluck out fear from herself by a brutal wrench at 
her own thought It’s nothing, it’s nothing, a little thing, 
she whispered within her She would treat it lightly as a 
physical incident to be passed over and forgotten All her 
life it must be that, not suffered to become an extravagant 
martyrdom, and she mocked at herself as she sat beside 
him for having allowed the word martyrdom to enter her 
mind “Well,” she said as though she were reproving a 
child, “why aren’t you m bed, Rupert?” and when his hand 
moved up flank and side, when he laid his mouth over hers 
and tried to hold her with one arm behind her shoulders, 
she drew away, but not beyond his reach, concealing her 
reluctance m a blind, unwilled coquetry that flooded her 
with self-contempt Her cheeks burned and a pulse leapt 
m her throat She knew that her beauty was inflamed by 
the burning of her cheeks He drew back from her as 
though from a sudden light, gazing in blinded wonder and 
awe, then, seizing her hand, pressed it against his face and 
spoke her name again and again m a low voice “Julie, my 
dearest, my Julie, my beloved” — again and again, quietly, 
m the recedmg voice of one withdrawing from her into the 
caves of his own mind 

She could say nothing but foolish broken things and 
because all that she could say was meaningless and without

power to check his illusion, she fell upon her knees at his 
feet and wrapped his hand in her hair as if she were bind- 
ing and imprisoning him While she knelt, with the dark- 
ness m her eyes and the knowledge of him stooping over 
her, she became aware that never, never since his return — 
never in my life, she added suddenly — had she said to him 
“I love you ” She would look up, and seek his face and say 
those words In the shadows of her hair they seemed true, 
being made true by her compassion and the reflected gentle- 
ness of his love for her, and she began to untwine his hand, 
believing that she could then raise her head and speak 
She could not He saw speech upon her lips and waited, 
but she could say nothing, and he, interpreting her silence 
by his own longing, took her by the upper arm and led her 
from the embrasure As they passed the screen across the 
door to the library, her shoulder struck it It rocked but 
stood, she drew m her lower lip, clipped it for an instant 
with her teeth, her imagination springing into the past, to 
Lewis’s figure framed m the open doorway, to the candle 
m his hand throwing the cheekbone shadows upward over 
his eyes And to-day, she remembered, when the heat had 
gone from the air, she had walked with him across the 
plateau behind Kerstholt’s cottage and looked down on to 
the thickening mass of Rynwyk Though they were silent 
on the edge of the plateau, Rupert was in their mmds 
Suddenly she had said “If I hadn’t been married when we 
met, Lewis, or if he had never come back, if he had been 

killed ’’AndLewis hadanswered “We might have been 

poorer than we are Whatever comes now comes to us with 
our eyes open,” and he had taken her m his arms and 
kissed her as he might have kissed a child They had not 
kissed since they ceased to be lovers A tremor had shaken 
her — not of desire itself but m question of desire — and she 
had reached up to his lips, wondering how it was that what 
had once been theirs abundantly was theirs no longer And 
she had thought If Rupert died and Lewis and I were left 
face to face — a thought that could not be completed 
It rose again m her mind now With Rupert near her 
and his power upon her, she understood that even his death

would not recover the past, she and Lewis were changed, 
whether they went on into the world apart or together, 
and, incapable of looking into the future, she submitted 
her thought to the pressure of the instant, seeing, as if they 
were not hers, her breast raised and tautened by the curling 
of her arm over her head, and, cutting the line of the breast, 
the curve of her hip, and beyond the hip a naked foot, 
silvered by candlelight as by being dippea in water The 
stumbling awkwardness of his maimed approaches drew 
her lips into a smile, pitying but cruel m its pity, a smile 
of which she was as much and as critically aware as an ex- 
ternal observer of it would have been, and to banish it from 
her mental sight, to extinguish finally the cold, solitary 
flame of individuality that licked at her like a whip, she 
threw her arm over Rupert's shoulder and turned to him 
and nuzzled her face into the hot pit of his throat 

Clamped m darkness, she could be still, an absolute 

E assivity quieted the tremors of her flesh, a whiteness, 
ke the shimmer of an opaque mist, stood between her 
and thought, nothing existed but the blur and sparkle 
under the fast-closed lids of her eyes But when Rupert 
forced up her head and the boundaries of her conscious- 
ness rolled back and back in the fierce panic of clouds 
before a gale, when his breath was on her cheek and his 
ecstasy included her, she was seized by terror lest he 
should die, should die upon her breast, and the desire to 
submit herself to him was all her desire — to be his as he 
believed her to be, but she could not recall herself from 
the drift of impersonality that bore her continuously away 
from him I am not here, she cried within her, I am not 
here, and she knew suddenly that all her limbs were stiff, 
her muscles m stress, her body stone 
At last he lay beside her, deep plunged m silence, his 
breathing inaudible, seemingly at peace She waited long, 
then spoke to him softly, he did not stir Was he fully 
asleep? She lifted him high on his pillows into the position 
m which he must sleep, leaned from the bedside to ex- 
tinguish the last candle, then lay still Time's drum beat 
upon her wakefulness its muffled and everlasting rhythm

At last, from the edge of sleep, his hand was blindly 
extended towards her as though he would be assured that 
what he dreamed now was indeed the fulfilment, and not 
the repetitive mockery, of his dreams She held his hand 
in hers and gazed at the canopy above her — a soaring 
wedge thrust into the shot pallor of the ceiling, a swerving 
bulk against the watery flicker of moonlight cast up by 
the lake, and hot tears, flowing back across her temples, 
grew cold and stiffened among the roots of her hair 

The memories and consequences of that night hung like 
a cloak upon her mind She knew that she had failed and 
must always fail When Rupert became aware of the 
finality of the division between them, his intuition would 
lead him to its nature and cause To accept his love and 
with her own forced responses to renew his patient ex- 
pectation was to add betrayal to betrayal In his imagina- 
tion of her, he was still blind, but his eyes would be opened 
and he would see the pit to which she had led him, to 
which, m dread and adoration, she was now leading him 
day by day Every tenderness of hers, every act of con- 
fidence or affection, seemed to her base and hypocritical, 
for he was inevitably her victim who received these out- 
ward signs as evidence of what was not and could never 
be And to escape from this torment of conscience and 
from her desire to confess, she would go out on to the 
moors alone and walk until thought was deadened in her, 
then return and stoop over her husband and kiss him 
with tears m her eyes 

During these days she refused Lewis’s companionship 
He and Rupert spent many hours together, then she could 
see him, but not alone She could listen to their conversa- 
tion, not pursuing the detail of it but yielding herself to 
its strength, its intimacy, its commanding freedom and 
impetus, and could feel with wonder and delight the 
pressure of circumstance that bound them and her to- 
gether But when the group broke up and Lewis, per- 
ceiving the new stress in her, begged her m words or with 
silent pleading to share it with him, she could not “Not

yet least of all with you ” They were divided from 
each other and frozen, every communication suspended, 
and in each mind was the thought, known to the other, 
that, though divided, they were bound as they had never 
been m the past, secretly dependent as prisoners are who 
m their solitudes tap and tap on the separating wall 
One morning, when he came to the Castle, he brought 
Ramsdell with him, and, after luncheon, Julie walked a 
little ahead of the others towards the boat-house with 
Ramsdell at her side 

“Have you come back to the cottage for good'*” she 
asked 

“For as long as I am wanted ” 

“Lewis asked you to come? Fm glad It's good that 
we should have you there ” 

“‘We’?” 

“Lewis and I,” and she put her arm m his 
They crossed the little bridge between the lakes and 
stood m silence on the opposite bank, looking across the 
water to the island and the tower 
“What is it you are trying to say ? ” she asked 
“Things that can’t be said ” 

“But to me?” 

He put his hand on hers for a moment, then, breaking 
the touch, said 

“It’s harder than you know, Julie You see, though it 
doesn’t affect you one way or the other, I’m an interested 
party But we can forget that or try to If I talk to you, 
I shall say things I don’t want to say You had better talk 
to me if I’m to be of any use What do you want me to 
do?” 

“Look after Lewis ” 

“And what of you?” 

“That’s my own battle,” she said “You can’t help me 
You can help him He’s doing no work?” 

“Not to any purpose I have tried to make him come 
away ” 

“Away from Enkendaal?” There was fear m her tone 
“Away from you Even more — away from your hus-

band,” Ramsdell answered “If Lewis hated him or was 
jealous of him, we should know our ground But Narwitz 
has thrown a spell on him as he has on you My God, 
Julie, if you and Lewis were just separated lovers hungry 
for each other, it would be plain enough I know that 

sort of torment when I see it, but this ” 

Sophie and Allard’s wife were advancing towards them 
across the bridge, but paused, leaning on the rail, with 
white dresses blazing m the sun 
Julie kept her eyes on the two distant figures 

“What drew me to Lewis first of all was ” She 

clasped and unclasped her hands “It’s not easy to say, 
even to you — even to myself ” 

Ramsdell waited “Go on,” he said 
“It’s just a coward who can’t bear her own secrets — 
stripping herself of them,” she answered “It’s damnable 
for you ” 

“Julie, my dear, say what you have to say I’d rather 
hear it than watch the stifled look on your face while all 
this is baffling and choking you ” 

“It seemed easy at the beginning,” she said “I thought 
that, if we became lovers, after a little time the madness 
would pass, I shouldn’t be thirsty any more, I should be 
able to be happy with him again, working and talking — 
just being with him, and I imagined that when the time 

came to part ” 

“My poor Julie 1 ” 

“I was mad,” Julie said “So was he And yet, 
looking back on ourselves as we were then, ringed round 
m this place, it seems reasonable enough still So easy to 
return to our separate lives outside the ring — some day 
Now we are caught in it ” 

“Still loving each other?” 

“Loving?” She was asking that question of herself 
“Passion is dead — or asleep,” she said, speaking calmly 
and without bitterness “No, not dead and broken, not 
worn out and frayed and ugly, but once, you see, it was — 
the colour of a world we had made for ourselves, and

“Now the world has become real? The fate of Adam 
and Eve when they were driven out of Paradise,” Ramsdell 
said “Not exceptional, Julie ” 

She smiled “No Not exceptional That doesn’t make 
it easier And the odd thing is that the world hasn’t 
become real yet If it had, either we should have parted 
and put it all behind us, or we should be meeting secretly 
and leaving Rupert out of our thoughts, or we should be 
waiting for him to die, wanting him to die so that we could 
be together But Rupert has become the most powerful in- 
fluence in my life — and m Lewis’s What we are now we 
are because of him and what we become we shall become 
because of him I can’t tell you why, but it is so When 
you know him, you’ll understand I don’t love him, except 
as one loves a god His love for me, his bodily love I mean, 
has a kind of terror in it for that reason, it is horrible to 
me because I worship him — because I worship him, do you 
understand?” She was breathless “I can’t overcome that 
shrinking I can’t It’s a kind of paralysis — like a dream in 
which you’re turned to stone, no will, no power of move- 
ment, just helpless And he thinks that it’s because he is 
maimed He thinks, with a dreadful humility that’s an 
agony to me, that he is repulsive I don’t know how to kill 

that idea m him I can’t I do everything I ’’She turned 

her head away 
“Is it a true idea?” 

“That he is physically repulsive? No ” 

“Truer than you will admit, Julie?” 

“No! no 1 ” She faced him, her eyes hard and shining 
“Don’t you understand? I am far beyond that — caring 
what happens to my body All I care for is to let his im- 
agination of me fulfil itself He has lost everything else, 
everything he has ever loved or honoured or hoped for is 
poured into me There’s nothing earthly left to him but 
his idea of me If I broke that, if he knew the truth, he’d 
go mad But he shan’t know He has a power of seeing and 
understanding everything, except that one thing He sees 
through a thousand shams and pretences, you can’t lie to 
him, he has a light m him that shows him his own truth

through all lies But not about Lewis and me It’s a kind 
of protective blindness He shall never know, neither 
through me nor through Lewis ” 

“And Sophie?” Ramsdell said 

Julie flinched and gazed at the white figure above the 
waterfall “She hasn’t the courage She would have told 
him before now She will shrink and shrink from it when- 
ever she looks into his face We must go back,” she 
added “I promised to take Rupert across to the island ” 
“Why to the island?” 

“He likes to be there ” 

“Alone?” 

They had begun to walk down to the bridge Julie 
stopped abruptly “It’s only lately that he has wanted to 
go there ” 

“Escape?” 

She shook her head “No He doesn’t need to escape 
That’s the difference between him and Lewis Lewis’s 
motive has always been escape — deep down Rupert has 
almost passed through that to a final stability He doesn’t 
need to be physically alone He’s not earthbound as we 

are except ” She broke off, perhaps m doubt of her own 

thought, perhaps m hesitation to express it 
“Except m you, Julie?” 

“Perhaps ” 

“Then why the island? Does he let you stay with him 
there?” 

“I row him there and leave him Then fetch him again ” 
“Often?” 

“Almost every day now ” 

“Have you ever offered to stay with him there?” 
“Once,” she said “He didn’t want me,” and she could 
say no more 

Ramsdell saw that she was trembling and gripped her 
hand “Tell me, Julie, what you are afraid of?” 

“I can’t tell you I don’t know myself There’s no reason 
in it ” And she repeated “No reason, just vague fear ” 
But he continued to hold her and at last she said with the 
impulse of thought new to her own mind “What I said

was untrue — about his thinking I shrank from him because 
he was maimed It was true at first He did think that He 
doesn’t now He’s feeling in his mind for the reason And 
one day, when I bring him back from the island, he will 
know ” 

Narwitz felt his peril before he was aware of its nature, 
and when at last he knew that Julie was lost to him the 
knowledge seemed to be at once sudden and old He was 
walking towards the Castle from his chair by the lake, 
leaning on Lewis’s arm “We shot our bolt last spring,” 
he was saying “Since then the French reserves have been 
reorganized and Americans have been poured into France 
Our summer offensives ” and while he continued to 
speak of the war the knots of his deeper thought were un- 
ravelled Julie’s shrinking from him when she was off her 
guard, her propitiatory gentleness when her will com- 
manded her, the strained reserve and the swift, yielding 
intimacies of her behaviour towards Alison — all these evi- 
dences and many others, which had long seemed contra- 
dictory and puzzling, were reconciled in his mind, and the 
truth came to him with indisputable authority as though 
an inner voice had spoken it His fingers tightened on 
Lewis’s wrist and an agony like tongues of flame licked at 
his knee-caps and ran up the back of his head His sudden 
understanding that the man whose wrist he held was Juliet 
lover provoked in him no sort of revulsion, but he did not 
wish to look into Lewis’s face, for a curtain would have 
been lifted from its secret, its familiarity would have be- 
come unfamiliar, the dark intelligence of the eyes would 
be poisoned, and m its calm, which was the mirror of their 
friendship, would appear the turbulence of fleshly images 
He would not look into his face, nor anywhere but at the 
brown and grey and blue of the shining gravel and at the 
gleaming toes of his own boots that flashed and receded 
above it, for when he lifted his eyes beyond this little circle 
of vision he would encounter a world that had become 
barren with the barrenness of insanity — a despair full of 
the appearances of joy

At the steps of the verandah, hearing voices above him, 
he was compelled to look up Van Leyden and his wife 
were propped against the railing, Sophie stood beside them 
with a basket of flowers on her hard, sallow arm and a pair 
of scissors hanging by a cord from her wrist, and Julie 
herself was on the steps She took his arm from Alison’s 
and crooked it in her own 

“Now,” she said 

The ascent of the verandah steps exhausted him “Let 
me rest,” he said, when she would have led him indoors, 
and, seated m a wicker-chair, he gazed at the pairs of eyes 
looking anxiously down upon him, gazed at them with 
curiosity, wondering how it was that these people with 
known features and voices were unaware of having become 
grotesques, and he saw before him the routine of this day, 
and of all the days that must follow it, as a series of dead 
experiences, aping life and mocking it, leading to nothing 
but an everlasting and vain repetition of themselves He 
shut his eyes “My dear, are you llP” said Julie’s voice, 
and he beheld m imagination the twist of her shoulders as 
she stooped over the body of a man lying in a chair With 
what tenderness she had spoken 1 With what warmth of 
affection her hands enclosed his hand, rubbing it between 
her palms so that he could hear the movement of her flesh 
on his dry skin’ He began to suppose that the knowledge 
which had visited him as he came across the gravel was 
part of a dream from which he would awake, and once 
more he said within him, as he had said a thousand times 
during the years of fighting Nothing is lost while she 
remains, all that perishes is reborn in her He opened 
his eyes, reliant upon this faith, which was the rock of 
his soul But his eyes showed him her beauty sterile of 
consolation He was a child whose mother’s breast was 
entwined with adders, he was the dead summoned to 
resurrection whose saviour spat upon him and choked him 
with cerements His head fell over on its cheek and a long 
ohudder contorted his body So he lay, smelling the hot 
odour of Sophie’s flowers, and screaming m his throat 
soundlessly 



CHAPTER SEVEN 

That evening there were guests at the Castle and Julie 
dined with them Upstairs, Narwitz lay in bed, and near 
to him, at Julie’s small table, his nurse ate her meal His 
eyes did not move from her, and when she asked him with 
a determined smile why he found her so interesting to- 
night he made no answer To be stared at m this way she 
found embarrassing, until she understood that he was 
staring not at her, but at the place at table that she occupied 
Then with professional curiosity she returned his gaze 
When Julie entered the room his expression changed 
He looked at her with surprise as though he had not ex- 
pected her to come or had imagined a different appearance 
in her, and the nurse, who had no great liking for young 
married women, particularly if they were the wives of her 
patients and rich enough to live at ease, nevertheless felt 
for Julie an obscure sympathy and spoke kindly to her, 
saying that she looked tired and that she must not be 
troubled for Mynheer, he had been lying very quietly and 
there seemed to be no danger of an attack of asthma, the 
heat at noon must have been too much for him — no more 
than that “And now I will be leaving you, Mevrouw, if 
there’s no more I can do I will look m again at ten ” 
When Julie advanced to Narwitz’s bedside and said that 
she had come up to play to him, a wave of uncontrollable 
emotion broke upon his mind — such emotion as had often 
tormented him when he was a child and a pleasure had 
been offered to him which, in ordinary circumstances, 
would have been a great pleasure, but was made intolerable 
by its contrast with a wild mood of loneliness or despair

He remembered that on the days before his returns to 
school his mother, who hated his school as he did, would 
spend the evening with him and allow him to choose their 
pastime In the summer he would say, “Let’s walk in the 
garden,” and they would wander beyond the garden to the 
edge of the sweet-smelling wood and return by way of the 
fruit-garden, where he plucked apricots from a wall and 
munched them slowly in the dark In winter, he would 
say, “Let’s sing together,” and would stand at her side 
while she played songs of his choosing, but the delight of 
each song was an agony to him, and it was a test of his 
courage to keep his voice clear, a test of his chivalry not 
to let his mother guess how his heart ached Those songs, 
those apricots — their poisoned melody, their tragic taste* 
How ridiculously he had suffered then — but how deeply! 
No child of his should ever be made so raw by suffering 
that each touch of happiness was unbearable 

He had made this resolve long ago and confirmed it a 
thousand times Now he knew that he would have no child 
to whom he might show pity, and he looked at Julie as he 
might have looked at her if she had been dead 

“What shall I play?” she asked He tried to answer but 
could not He wished to answer because he felt no enmity 
towards the girl at his bedside but only grief for the 
vanished being of whom she now represented the bodily 
shell, and he saw m the movement of her mouth that his 
silence frightened her But to choose the music she was to 
play had become impossible for him and he was glad when 
she said “Then I shall choose and you shall listen,” and 
turned away 

There was a long silence In her music-room she was 
undressing and letting down her hair She had been 
accustomed, while she did this, to chatter to him through 
the open door Now he heard only the waterfall until 
suddenly the melody of a trio of Mozart’s cancelled all 
life external to itself, framing imagination by its own 
fulfilments 

When it was done, she called out “Do you remember?” 
and began at once to play again For more than an hour

she played, now on her piano, now on her clavichord, 
then returned to his room, her face childishly anxious and 
eager, desiring, he knew, nothing so much as assurance 
that, as m the past, her music had soothed him, made him 
happy and “washed the dreams out of his sleep ” He 
remembered the spring evening on which she had first 
used this phrase, stooping over his pillow and moving her 
fingers m his hair “You are very gentle with me/’ he had 
answered, and now, when he made himself repeat the 
words, she looked searchmgly at him as if she were half 
aware of listening to an echo 

Next morning, when he awoke, he had slipped low m 
the bed The old grip of an ingrowing armour was on his 
body and the nurse had to be summoned to help Julie lift 
him All day and for many days afterwards pain con- 
tinued, until it appeared to him as a thing having life m 
itself, combative, wilful, unsleeping, a cruel enemy, and 
he began to imagine, as he had in the past, that it had a 
face and hands and observant eyes that pursued him His 
agony was sharpened by knowledge that this pain, which 
might be said m loose phrase to have returned, had in 
truth never been absent from him, for a little while he had 
been its master, shutting against it the door of his inmost 
mind, which now stood open, submitting him to invasion 
and recapture 

He could resist no more The sustained determination, 
which had enabled him to establish over himself a rule of 
conduct and spirit, sufficed now to control his conduct 
only He would not confess that his sickness had increased, 
he would not speak to Lewis or to Julie of what he knew, 
he would cling to the outward forms of his association with 
them and of his life m Enkendaal But within him was 
anarchy The spirit is ruled by expectations and memories, 
of which the first were gone, the second unendurable 

His defence being down, he lay open to every attack — 
above all to the torments of pleasure m a heart forbidden 
peace As the sound of music, summoner of ghosts, had 
become the enforcement and cruel accent of his desola- 
tion, so were all his former delights of sense and thought

changed to serpents about him, and beyond the range 
of his will —as though he were indeed possessed by a 
succuba, alien to his knowledge of himself— he burned 
with perceptions of female shape and texture, desire, 
having ceased to spring naturally from personal love, 
assuming, m the mind’s pit, a vile anonymity of limb and 
muscle and mere attitude Yet, when he might have taken 
Julie, for she would refuse him nothing, he felt that he 
was divided from her by a wall of glass, and by the same 
barrier he was cut off from different pleasures, even from 
the tranquillities of Nature and meditation 

The sound of water, so long interwoven with a faith 
now perjured, was a perpetual remembrancer of loss, and 
from the warmth of the sun he would withdraw his hand 
sharply as though it had been dipped into an irrecoverable 
past 

From his conversations with Lewis, which he bound 
himself to continue, reality was emptied out It seemed, 
indeed, a kind of hypocrisy to debate the theory of con- 
templation after he had become incapable of practising it, 
and m the midst of argument, remembering that behind 
Lewis’s eyes was knowledge of his own secret, he became 
suddenly weary and fell into drifting silences, aware only 
of the pam eating his body and of the little patch of sight — 
the arm of a chair, the knot in a tree branch, a twig bobbing 
in the water — immediately before his eyes This was his 
only relief — to confine consciousness to a gleam of varnish 
or the wet glistening of an inch of bark, to enlarge his 
thought was to stumble madly over a desert without limit 
m space or time, and to remember who he was and to what 
single folly of love he had confided his being was to be 
filled with shame for the failure of all his purposes Against 
the orders of his doctor, he insisted that Julie should again 
and again row him to the island and leave him there He 
wished for nothing but to be secret, hiding himself from 
the inquisition of memories, and when, m the late after- 
noons, he heard the low clack of rowlocks and the spray of 
approaching blades, he would come down to the island 
bank and, keeping his gaze fixed not on Julie but on the

slack plume of the bow wave, struggle to ask himself who 
it was that came for him m the boat Who is she? he 
said, reaching out towards an unattainable impersonality, 
and until she spoke, twisting her shoulders towards him 
and allowing the shimmer or the water to flow upon her 
throat and breast, he could hover on the edge of delusion 
“Are you ready?” she would ask and, leaning on her oars, 
exclaim softly “Don’t move, Rupert Listen ” Her oars 
ceased to drip, the ripple at the bows flattened and shone, 
time waited, mild and golden 

Lewis was aware of the change m Narwitz and had little 
doubt of its cause, but he did not speak of it to Julie She 
was clinging still to her hope that the past would be 
swallowed up She would not look beyond the saving of 
her husband’s body, which she had set up as a limiting 
symbol of her task, deadening thought and setting bounds 
to her imagination by nursing him, playing to him, making 
herself more and more a slave of his infirmities That 
she had already failed in her struggle, Lewis could not 
bring himself to tell her She would know and suffer soon 
enough 

Meanwhile, during the last weeks of August, Narwitz’s 
guarded knowledge hung over all their lives He behaved 
towards Julie with a mingling of tenderness and pity and 
curiosity that made Lewis turn his face away and, when 
he could, move out of earshot, for this was the tragic 
curiosity with which a man might observe on the stage 
an actress’s representation of a woman he had loved, 
marvelling at the outward vitality and resemblance, 
stricken by the lack of inward likeness, perceived by him 
only The same look of incredulous investigation Lewis 
found turned upon himself Narwitz did not regard him 
with bitterness or reproach, but as a man might regard 
his friend whom fate had chosen as the instrument of his 
destruction On the surface was the same gentleness and 
patience, the same rule against pain, the same heroic 
reticence by which Narwitz had always been distinguished, 
but the spiritual passion which had made him seem godlike

and invulnerable was gone He was haunted, and some- 
times m the evening, when he returned from the island, 
he wore an expression of loss and despair, as though, look- 
ing down into the waters of his own soul, he had found 
there no substance and no image 

Julie became more and more afraid of his visits to the 
island, and would invent arguments to keep him m the 
garden, on the verandah, m the library — anywhere but m 
the encirclement of the dark trees and the lapping water 
On an afternoon of early September she pleaded the ex- 
treme heat of the day and the approach of a thunderstorm 
The island was dangerous, she said, he would be wet 
through before she could reach him, the trees drew light- 
ning down, only withm the thick walls of the library might 
he be cool and safe Her words came from her m nervous 
disorder She could not choose them or govern their stress, 
she cared only that he should not go away mto the solitude 
that had become terrible in her imagination He looked 
at her as though she were a child whom he wished to 
humour, then, with a smile at the corners of his lips, 
consented He and she and Lewis went together mto the 
library 

Day after day for nearly a week the sun had blazed m an 
unclouded and windless sky This morning it had become 
a honey-coloured disc seen through a shroud of thickening 
atmosphere, the heat had dampened and increased, little 
fierce gusts followed by an expectant stillness had set the 
trees hissing and had shaken the surface of the lakes, the 
air had been alive with flying insects Now the library was 
filled by the white glare that awaits the sudden darkness 
of storm, but the storm did not break and the heat 
continued 

Seated on a stool, with her body pressed against the cold 
wall, Julie listened to the men’s voices This tnple associa- 
tion, which had once seemed to her beautiful and miracu- 
lous and flowering, was dying now as certainly as a poisoned 
flower She was lonely and afraid She was filled with an 
aching desire to tell Rupert the truth, to tell him now, m 
Lewis’s presence, so that their frozen relationship might

become fluid again and life, however bitter, return to her 
But she remained m the shadow, her eyes moving now and 
then from one to the other of the two faces above her One 
man she loved as a god who m his mind had created her 
and whom she had betrayed, the other with a profound, 
mourning, sterile tenderness as one loves the irrevocable 
dead From each she was finally separated, to each eternally 
bound She gazed at Lewis’s eyes, deeply set above hard 
cheeks made angular by the fall of light, at his lips which 
long ago, when he was sleeping beside her, she had touched 
with her fingers that she might feel the shape that the 
darkness partly concealed from her, and at his hand, lying 
spread upon his knee, which had once been the core of her 
desire Was she finally separated from him? The neutrality 
of her senses, the power she now had to examine and to 
ask, fell upon her mind like a blight, and turning away 
from the beloved features, as she might have turned, in 
the exhaustion of barren love, from contemplation of the 
dead, she looked out at the staring sky, her ribs thrust 
against the stone 

And when there came up from the village the ringing 
of the church bell, the sound seemed at first to be falling 
to her out of the metallic sky, she received no meaning 
from it Then she stiffened, sat erect, her head raised, 
listening The ringing was even and regular, there was 
persistence but no urgency m the beat 

“What is it?” 

“A fire m the woods,” she said “Listen There’ll be a 
break in the ringing soon Then single strokes, slowly, to 
tell the direction,” and, the single strokes beginning as 
she spoke, she counted them “One — North, two — North- 
East, three — East ” There was a brief interval The 
continuous ringing began again 

“That’s the virtue of the Dutch,” Rupert said “Even 
their alarm bells haven’t the panic of alarm Nothing 
excites them ” 

“Three — East,” Julie repeated “In the woods between 
here and the Huis ten Borgh Lewis, you and I ought 
to go Uncle Pieter expects the whole countryside to go .

Outside the Castle the air stirred, warm and soft, against 
their faces, not in distinguishable gusts, but as though the 
whole atmosphere were rocking a little to and fro No single 
tree moved perceptibly, but now and then a shudder of 
autumnal yellow passed through the greenness of the high 
wood as the edges of innumerable leaves were curled up- 
ward into the light, and on the surface of the water beady 
patches formed and vanished as though a giant were breath- 
ing on his shield 

In the sky, cloudless but opaque, the sun was embedded, 
its rays seeming to spurt out upon the earth as from a 
molten pit Beneath its influence the dry heather of the 
moor and the late gorse close to the ground received a silken 
gloss Every rounded stone was magnified by the violence 
of its own shadows and each chip of pebble that held a 
facet skyward cast up a piercing splinter of light Though 
her shade was thrown in front of her, Julie walked with 
her eyes narrowed, listening to the slip and crackle of the 
turf under her feet 

“If the fire is far away,” she said, “Goofs people from 
the Huis ten Borgh will be there before ours ” 

They talked for a few minutes of the fire, then fell 
into silence Ahead of them was Kerstholt, both his legs 
hanging loose on the on-side of his shambling pony, with 
pick and shovel and axe clutched to him, and Ramsdell, 
now walking, now trotting, near at hand The Baron and 
Allard, mounted, with four others, passed them, the Baron 
turning m his saddle to wave to Julie and again to shout 
to Kerstholt, who raised his hand m acknowledgement and

let his teeth gleam m the sun Across the low undulations 
of the moor, figures m blue smocks, some on ponies, some 
carrying tools, some with children at their heels, appeared, 
vanished and reappeared 

Long silences shared with Lewis steadied and comforted 
Julie as words could not have done Their companionship 
before they had become lovers floated into her memory, a 
strange companionship in which she had often teased and 
provoked him, partly in mischief and partly, though she 
had not known it, m defence He arose from the past as 
he had then seemed to her, and such was her power of 
accepting illusion that she began to lose herself m the past 
and to recover, as though they now came to her for the first 
time, ideas and hopes and misgivings which had been hers 
more than two years ago, to recover and to experience them 
afresh, to perceive as delicious uncertainties questions to 
which, in fact, the answer was declared Her mind was 
lightened — perhaps for no more than a fragment of a second 
— of its present burdens, and recaptured the brilliance, the 
seemingly inviolable isolation, of her first joys — her joy m 
his freedom and in her own, her rapturous sense of transla- 
tion to a world m which time and consequence were with- 
out effect, there being no inhabitants of it but he and she 

Not venturing to look at him, she took his hand, think- 
ing Whatever comes, that ecstasy can never be again, and 
they walked on hand m hand until a rise of the ground 
brought them within sight of a group of woodmen who 
were resting their tools and mopping the sweat from brow 
and throat 

During their walk there had hung m the sky before 
them, alternately revealed and hidden by folds m the 
moors, tufts of smoke like grey wool which appeared not 
to move and to change shape but slowly Now, as they 
paused on high ground, they saw that this cloud had be- 
come paler and was drifting away m thin, trailing wisps 
“The fire’s under,” Lewis said, but they went forward for 
another couple of miles until they met the Baron returning 
“No great damage,” he cned and rode on, beckoning them 
to turn and pointing to the western sky where the storm

so long expected had brought up its forces at last The sun 
was swallowed m its pit, sullen clouds, ridged here and 
there with an angry yellow froth, were growing downward 
upon the earth, and beneath them the moor had sprung 
into a hard-edged illumination against which each shoulder 
of ground, each hastening figure, each tree and copse stood 
up as though clipped from iron 

“There’s a chance it won’t last,” Lewis said “Let’s 
make for that wood ” 

Before they reached the wood, heavy drops had begun 
to fall and soon the ram was hissing among the branches 
above them They found a hut set up last year by woodmen 
who had felled a neighbouring copse, it still had value as 
a shelter but was dark and so low-roofed that they could 
not stand upright m it They crouched silently, listening 
to the ram The temperature had changed suddenly as 
though heat were being sucked out of the air Wherever 
the ram penetrated, the pme-needles and the undergrowth 
threw up a thin steam 

“I suppose it’s useless to stay here,” Julie said “Shall 
we go on through it?” 

He did not answer, but took off his jacket and wrapped 
it about her shoulders, his action saying plainly that he 
wished her to stay with him, and she acquiesced, glad 
that they should be together and that the pressure of her 
anxieties should be lifted if only for a little while by the 
chance which held them m the ribbed gloom of this 
hut 

“I don’t want to move,” she said “The ram is a curtain 
that shuts everything out I should like this minute to go 
on and on Never to have to go back ” 

“Are you afraid, Julie?” 

“Tired,” she answered, “of fighting and deceiving If he 
had been a different man, or had thought differently of me, 
it would have been bearable to deceive — and to undeceive 
him As it is ” She interlaced her fingers and for a 
moment pressed the backs of them against her forehead, 
closing her eyes as though her head were aching “I am 
failing,” she continued “I know that I don’t know why

When he came and I saw who he was and what he was, I 
was afraid He was so different from anything I had im- 
agined He made what I had done seem terrible His life 
stood up suddenly between yours and mine, like a moun- 
tain risen out of the earth That frightened me first — losing 
you And the suspense of secrecy frightened me Mother 
knew, Sophie knew, and, worst of all, when we met — you 
and I — there was this concealment freezing us And nothing 
of what was m the mmds of us four was ever spoken of It 
made all life like an animal waiting to spring And I 
wanted to make good, Lewis — to him, I mean Something 
m me” — she looked at him, shy before the word that was 
m her mmd — “my salvation depended on it, my integrity ” 
She paused again, listening to the patter and hiss of the 
wood “And, after a little while,” she said, “something m 
him made me cease to be afraid Everything seemed pos- 
sible — except that I should ever love him fully, as he wished 
to be loved Everything else seemed possible And he be- 
came happier, stronger He suffered, but he passed through 
suffering as one passes through ram Now, he’s changed 
In some dreadful way, he’s breaking up It’s not just that 
he has more pam but that pam affects him more The news 
from Germany and from the front — he reads it now with 
a kind of bitter despair He had written off his losses, he is 
counting them again You, too, know that, Lewis ” 

“I know he is changed,” Lewis answered, “but whether 
he is breaking up or will become more than he has ever 
been, I don’t yet know ” 

“Why do you say that?” she asked, and, her thought 
drifting away from her own question, she added suddenly 
m a low, agitated voice “What I am afraid of is that he 
may kill himself I’m sure it’s m his mmd, Lewis He 
endures, he doesn’t complain, he has an outward calm, 
still, but his tranquillity is gone Always I am afraid that 
there’ll be no answer when I go out to the island m the 
boat At night, when he lies awake, sometimes I speak to 
him, he doesn’t answer He’s like a prisoner lying m 
chains, waiting ” 

“But he will not kill himself,” Lewis said 



THE BOND 


CH VIII 


35i 


Her breath was quickened “Once he said to me that 
it was a way a man was entitled to take ” 

“But he will not take it,” Lewis replied “He has out- 
grown violence, even to himself ” 

She looked at him as though his refusal to be persuaded 
to her own terror of suicide were a harshness against her 
For an instant he asked himself Did she desire Narwitz’s 
death? Was her fear of suicide a means of cloaking that 
desire, of protecting herself from it? 

“Julie,” he said, “if Narwitz were dead — what then?” 
“Don’t you understand?” she answered “I should have 
killed him We should have killed him ” She clasped 
her hands in front of her and stared through the opening 
in the hut at the trunk of a pme tree that was creaking 
and whining m the upper wind, and Lewis perceived that 
the idea of Narwitz’s death hung over her like a sentence 
of death upon herself Her arms were stiffened and her 
shoulders weighted by the terror of an unendurable 
finality “When we loved each other,” she said, “we didn’t 
know, Lewis We didn’t know what we were doing And 
the joy we had then is turning into thirty pieces of silver ” 
The hysterical violence, the ugly theatncalism of that 
phrase filled her with shame as soon as she had spoken it, 
and she threw up her head, her lips hardened and her 
cheeks twitching under tearless eyes Then, the tension in 
her bre akin g, she sighed and sat back on her heels like a 
desperate, unhappy child, and stretched out her hand 
“Lewis, what are we to do? What can we do? If he finds 
out the truth now, he will kill himself ” 

Agam, again this obsessed fear of physical death, Lewis 
thought, this jealous clinging to it ! And, casting about m 
his mi nd for words to comfort her, he understood that her 
fear of Narwitz’s death was forced upon her by another 
and greater fear that her imagination dared not encompass 
She was speaking, m terms of the body, of the death of the 
soul 

He held her hand fast m his own and said “I think he 
knows the truth, Julie ” 

Her fingers jerked in his grasp but he held them Her

eyes widened, her lips parted, the colour ebbed from her 
face 

“He can’t know,” she said, and repeated it slowly 
and softly “He can’t know ” Then, m a flood of words, 
like the beating of fists against a door suddenly closed 
“He can’t He can’t, Lewis Why do you say that? If he 
knew, he would have spoken to me He would have been 
angry He’d have been wild and mad And you — could he 
go on seeing you, saying nothing, doing nothing?” 

“You forget who he is and what he is,” Lewis answered 

A long silence was broken only by her saying m a vague, 
light voice “The ram is stopping ” But the rain, un- 
accompanied by thunder or lightning, continued to fall 
The undergrowth steamed no more Dusk, stretching its 
web over the trees, drew Lewis’s thoughts into a wood 
outside Cheppmg wherein he and she had been caught by 
a summer storm years ago Nothing but the grave music of 
ram and foliage distinguished this walk from the many 
others in which he had been her companion when she was 
a child, during all the intervening time it had not risen 
out of his memory, but now the scent of the Cheppmg 
wood was m his nostrils and her slim figure pressed against 
a tree was before his eyes It had been the backs of her 
hands that she pressed against the bark, the tendons of 
her wrists had stood up beneath the tightly buttoned cuffs 
she was wearing She had lifted her chin so that the drops 
from the branches above her might splash on her face, and, 
laughmg, had cried out with a note of disappointment m 
her voice “I believe it’s stopping, Lewis I believe it is ” 
“What are you thinking?” she asked now 
“About Cheppmg ” 

She drew in a slow, deep breath “You will go back 
there,” she said, looking at him as a child might look into 
the face of some legendary traveller, and he asked her 
whether she would ever come to him m Cheppmg 
“To visit you?” 

This had been his uncertain thought, but now, challeng- 
ing his own doubts and hers, he said “To be with me ” 
She smiled “Even if that ever became possible, I

should be a poor ally, Lewis We knew that long ago,” 
and she added — “even when we loved each other ” 

“ ‘Even when ' Is it done, Julie?” 

“Is it?” she repeated “Once it was my blood, my light, 
my madness Now, though you are more dear to me than 
ever before, when you touch me, I feel old There's no 
madness left ” She faced him “You, too If I were free to 
be your wife, if Rupert were dead, still — between you and 
me — O Lewis, you know it's true 1 ' 

“That we are separated?” 

“That I should break your life as I have broken his 
Even now,” she said with deliberation, “I stand between 
you and all that's best m you You are doing no work 
Ramsdell told me that You sent for him — you, who were 
always content to be alone You are on edge as I am This 
place, which was once solitary and encircled, your peace, 
the foundation of your peace — you let me into it — you see 
what it has become ” 

“Not through your fault, Julie ” 

“It is the consequence that matters,” she said, “the 
consequence — not the intention I didn't intend what I 
have done to him or to you I loved you ” She picked up 
a handful of pme-needles and let them stream over her 
palm “The pardonable becomes unpardonable indepen- 
dently of us The sin, though it seemed not to be a sin, 
grows to the stature of what we sin against Its spiritual 
consequence leaps up and grows and burns like a forest 
fire I see that now There’s no escape from it None for 
ourselves, none for those we sm against ” 

“Unless we pass through the fire ” 

“Through it?” 

“Unburned ” 

“That is for the gods,” she said “Even Rupert is 
failing It was to have been the miracle of his life that he 
should pass unscorched through every fire He has passed 
through so much But his love for me has trapped him 
Now at any rate,” she added m a voice of anguish and 
relief, “we need not be silent We can go to him and 
eay ”

“Not now,” Lewis answered “Give him time not to 
fail, Julie He has transcended every other loss He is 
beyond any help we can give or any reparation we can 
make ” 

He said this so quietly and with so profound a passion 
that Julie, hearing again in his voice that ring of devotion 
and exaltation which had first set him apart from other 
men m her eyes, turned to him m sharp wonder, in the 
delight of rediscovery “You love him,” she exclaimed 
“You could not speak like that if you did not love him ” 

“As a pupil loves his master,” Lewis replied, and, going 
out of the hut, he looked up through the branches to 
the sky, seemg that the storm had passed The branches, 
even the highest, moved little The wind had dropped and 
between the western beeches a reddened sun was slanting 
into the wood Julie also came out, and stood beside him 

Through showering sprays they went on to the moor 
As the gloom of the copse fell back and the great expanse 
of the evening sky shone upon their faces, they were 
touched by the blissful awe of those who, in the instant of 
beauty or love, are bound m a common wonder and look 
deeply mto one another and speak silently as they cannot 
at other times For the spirit of man is blind and dumb 
except God touch him, and awake, m the winter of his 
flesh, the spring of his immortality 

The air, cooled and polished by rain, had that trans- 
parency with which at sundown on wet evenings it is 
sometimes invested, as though the substance of it had 
been drawn away and there remained between earth's 
floor and dome only a lucent emptiness edged with 
crystalline fires Soon the crystal would be stained by 
dusk, the forms of earth thicken and mght flow on, but 
for a little while the trees dreamed above their shadows 
and time slept Lewis and Julie waited At last, when 
the heather had begun to darken, they set out towards 
Enkendaal 



CHAPTER NINE 


“Soon after you had gone,” the nurse said to Julie, “I 
gave him his tea and sat with him in the library while 
he was drinking it He didn’t speak, but that’s not un- 
common ” 

“He wasn’t more silent than usual? I mean,” Julie asked 
with hesitation, “did it strike you that he had anything 
special on his mind?” 

“Either a man’s silent or he’s not, Mevrouw No, 
I thought nothing Afterwards, when he had finished 
his tea, he held out his cup for me to take He’d have 
dropped it, I believe, if I hadn’t taken it quick Then he 
said he was tired, he would go to the bedroom ‘A pity,’ 
he said, ‘that wall-staircase isn’t open We shall have to 
go down into the hall and up ’ He went over and tried the 
handle of the door ‘Why,’ I said, ‘that staircase hasn’t 
ever been open as far as I’ve heard ’ ‘I know,’ he said, 
but he went on worrying the handle as though he was 
afraid of the climb down into the hall and up again 
‘Come,’ I said, ‘we shall manage it easily ’ 

“Well, it was hard going down,” the nurse continued, 
“harder than it’s ever been, and before we got up to the 
bedroom we had to stop several times — not that he wasn’t 
ready to go on, he’ll stand anything, but he was heavy on 
my arm ” 

“You put him to bed?” 

“On the bed He wouldn’t let me undress him, Mevrouw 
He lay down and shut his eyes In two or three minutes 
he seemed to be asleep ”

v eiling doors open so that she might hear if he rang, the 
nurse had gone to her own room She was tired with much 
standing and had put her feet up There was thunder m 
the air and, a heaviness coming upon her, she had slept 
The sound of falling ram awakened her In his room she 
could not find him “The little table where you have your 
dinner sometimes, Mevrouw — it had been knocked over 

as though he had fallen against it, that was what frightened 

_ _ >> 
me 

Julie perceived that the nurse had been genuinely 
frightened and confused The panic peculiar to stolid 
natures when imagination begins to blow hot and cold 
upon them had awakened m her, and she had hurried 
through room after room searching for the man she did 
not hope to find m any of them He had gone out Where? 
He was incapable of going far The emptiness of the 
Castle — even the Baroness and Sophie having gone out 
to the fire — added to her alarm 

While she was telling how she had questioned the maid- 
servants who, “being of that class, Mevrouw, had stood 
“like dummies, gaping and wagging their stupid heads,” 
Julie imagined Rupert's secret struggle, his climb down- 
stairs unaided, his dragging step across the hall, his march 
into the air, and she tried to plumb his mind The nurse’s 
voice broke m with an exclamation of extreme self-content 
“Then I knew Of course, he had gone to the island*” 
Through the ram she had gone down to the boat-house 
“What a ram! The lake was all boiling and spitting with it 
and the gutters on the roof wouldn’t carry it, it was froth- 
ing over them and clattering on to the laurels like slides 
of snow ” The boat was gone, but she had taken the red 
dinghy No one to help her cast off the painter, it was 
slimy and its knot stiffened by disuse No one to help her 
row or bail She had sat there with water lapping at her

thought he was dead His toes were driven into the earth, 
his face was twisted upward and, though his eyes were 
open, she couldn’t see the pupils of them When, having 
felt him, she knew that he was alive, and had straightened 
his body, laying him on his back and propping him with 
leaves and branches, she had understood that his weight 
was more than she could hope to lift down to the boat, 
and, running to the water’s edge, had begun to shout for 
help Against the slash of the ram her voice would not 
carry, anyone not away at the fire would be sheltered in- 
doors There was nothing for it but to return as she had 
come and fetch help “I didn’t think to find him alive 
again, Mevrouw,” but when she reached the island a 
second time with Jacob and a stable-boy, the stiff, propped 
figure had shifted, the eyes expressed consciousness, the 
lips moved 

Julie knew already the little more that the nurse could 
tell, but she did not know in what mood Rupert had under- 
gone the ordeal of rowing himself across the upper lake 
The boat’s helm had been found lashed over Pulling 
against it with a single scull, he had landed on the island 
and allowed the boat to drift away, as though he had in- 
tended it to be of no more service to him 

Of the determination that had drawn him to the island 
he said nothing, and little of what had passed there An 
attack of dreadful severity had been suffered, the ram had 
chilled and stiffened him, he had lost consciousness m 
the belief that he would never recover it this was acknow- 
ledged to the doctor More he would not say, the subject 
appearing to have no interest for him Day and night, 
between sleeping and waking, he lay still, like an effigy 
on a tomb, seeming to regard all who approached his bed- 
side as inhabitants of a plane from which he was with- 
drawn 

In his own mind was an assurance that, upon the island, 
he had made a great part of the voyage of death and been 
recalled from it It was strange to him to hear it said that 
he had been unconscious, for, though the experience

through which he had passed would submit to none of 
the forms of thought and could not therefore be described 
even to himself, it had not been forgotten, the spiritual 
impression of it remained, as the impression of a poem 
may remain of which the words are no more remembered 
That it had been active and continuous he did not doubt, 
and, though his thought could not now encompass it — 
thought being an emanation of sense and this experience 
a conclusion from different premises — it was for him a 
reality so far transcending the appearances of his present 
state that he felt himself to be indeed a visitor from an- 
other world 

A desire not altogether to lose contact with this supreme 
experience from which he had been recalled dragged at 
him like a vanishing memory and produced m him, during 
the following days, a low delirium which was attributed 
by others to the pain and fever that he endured In fact, 
the pam and fever had little part in it, they like all else of 
this world being to him now m a manner fictitious, as 
though they were the sufferings of a body not his own, 
and he took no account of them until he found himself, 
as his doctor said, rallying, or, as it appeared to his own 
consciousness, slipping back into life To slip back finally, 
to forget what he had known and that he had known 
it, to accept delusion again and be no more possessed of 
that farther reality to which he felt himself to have been 
admitted, became the fear of his heart, and he asked Lewis, 
who visited him often, whether he supposed that Lazarus, 
raised from the dead, was in complete oblivion of what, 
m death, he had seen and known, or continued upon earth 
m the bliss and torment of unseizable memories He asked 
this question m many forms, continually reverting to the 
subject of it, until Lewis, who had at first supposed it to 
be the afterwash of delirium and had not seriously applied 
his mind to it, at last perceived its personal significance 
But Julie, when she saw that Rupert’s former will to 
live was gone from him, supposed that he despaired 
bitterly of this life, not guessing that he hungered for 
another as an exile for his own remembered country

“You must rouse him,” the doctor said “He is a great 
fighter, but he is fighting no longer,” and one night m 
the third week of October, having lam awake until she 
could no more endure the burden of silence, she rose and 
went, as she believed, to her necessary confessional, and 
kneeling beside his pillow stretched her arm across it, and 
took his head m the crook of her arm gently, and with her 
fingers touched his face 
“Rupert,” she said, “don’t shut me out ” 

She was warm from her bed and his face so cold against 
the softness of her arm that his silence filled her with 
sudden terror, but he answered her “You will make your- 
self ill, Julie You are uncovered The night’s cold ” 

“It’s not winter yet ” 

“No,” he said, “not yet ” 

The bleak futility of their words, the ungovernable, in- 
consequent words of a dream, stood across her mmd as a 
barrier between her and the confession she would make, 
and she said “You know what I have done, Rupert Is 
there nothing I can do now?” 

“My dear, all that is far away I am dying ” 

“No, no,” she whispered “Your voice sounds as if 
you were already dead You must not go m that bitterness ” 
“Not in bitterness,” he answered “In eagerness and 
m hunger ” 

“For death?” She laid her cheek upon his pillow 
“Though you know it already, let me say what I must say, 
Rupert I have been silent so long When it began be- 
tween Lewis and me, it seemed ” 

“No,” he said “You are telling me of this world and 
the body ” 

“Yes I ” 

He put his hand upon her m restraint “Julie, do not 
make me remember you ” 

From that she fell away and knelt beside the bed, not 
touching it 

“Is even the memory hateful?” 

A little dark cry issued from his throat as he perceived 
m what way she had misunderstood him

“It is not hatred that makes me wish to forget,” he said 
“But my love for you — which does not cease to be love, 
Julie — love m all fulness by this world’s reckoning — is 
among the things I must leave behind It held me to life, 
now it must consent that I go ” 

“Because I betrayed you?” 

“Not as you mean it, Julie Do not blame or hate your- 
self for my death There was a time when it seemed that 
you had been false and cruel I could see nothing but your 
falseness and cruelty I wanted to destroy the life that held 
the knowledge of them It was m that mood I went to the 
island I did not mean to come back In what I was changed 
I cannot tell you, that is the last secret, which I cannot 
tell even to myself But the breath of that change is upon 
my eyelids, bidding my eyes open, and the warmth of it 
m my soul like the sun m an apple yet upon the tree, and 
the taste of it on my lips like the taste of salt waves m the 
inland air And what I have tasted shall not be denied me 
What I leave behind — suffering and love — is becoming a 
shadow You are becoming a shadow and my love for you 
a story that was told me long ago Let it be so If I am to 
have peace and not fall back utterly into the despairs and 
raptures of that story, you must consent, and willingly 
let me go, without remorse or weeping or condemnation 
For even now, Julie, you might recall me With you, I 
might read all that story again and believe it true Even 
now, while you kneel beside me, the memory of it flows 
up Do not compel me to remember you ” 

“What shall I do to give you peace?” she asked 
“Let this be an end between us Afterwards, for the 
time that remains, think that I am already dead Let me 
be moved from here to the little room to which I was first 
taken and where, one night, happier than I have ever been, 
I fell asleep with my head upon your breast ” 

“You mean that I am not to see you again?” 

“No, Julie, I do not mean that But when I am able to 
die, I would go freely and alone, not held by the one fare- 
well that has power to hold me Let us say good-bye now

other In our own hearts let this be our parting, that we 
may not be tom apart m the last agony or the last failure 
of the body ” 

He paused and said “I married you without your love 
That was a great wrong ” 

She was speechless, and he spoke again “Now, Julie, 
good-bye May God keep you ” 

6 s he drew herself up to him and took his face be- 
tween her hands m the darkness “Come back to me, 
Rupert I shall not betray you ” Though his hand seized 
her wrist, he made no reply and, a finality greater than 
her desire for pardon shrouding her will, she could no 
more entreat him “Remember a little, then, in this 
moment,” she said, “before you forget for ever ” 

He drew her down and kissed her “I remember that 
without you there would be no world to leave ” Holding 
her shoulder, he asked “We are at peace?” 

“At peace, dear Rupert,” she said, struggling to see 
and remember his face 

“Then let us kiss once more, as travellers setting out ” 

When she had done as he asked and knew that her lips 
would not touch his again and that between them the 
recognitions of love were ended, she felt him take her hand 
and kiss it Then, knowing herself released, she turned 
away and lay down upon her own bed apart from him 
She believed that all night she would listen to the waterfall, 
but, in an instant, sleep with a sigh had taken her 



CHAPTER TEN 


In the smaller room to which he was now removed, 
Narwitz lay m peace, his eyes resting for long stretches of 
time on a little clock, framed by interlaced ribbons of gilt 
and covered by a convex glass, which was attached to the 
wall above the lintel The clock was an old one, its hands, 
like Chinese eyebrows, stood always at eight minutes to 
two, and, because it had so long ceased to give out any 
living command or stimulus, it had become, like the face 
of a priest experienced in confessions, deeply passive, 
receptive and impersonal Upon it his thoughts might 
converge without disturbance He could, moreover, when 
the night had been long, estimate day’s approach by the 
broadening gleam of that rounded face A white slip above 
the door, like a paring from a new moon, was the earliest 
hint of morning 

Even when struck by his agony and fighting for breath 
like a twisted animal run down in the street, he would 
compel his eyes to the gilded ribbons, as though there were 
help m them He wished to detach himself from the pam 
which his flesh endured, and often he succeeded, he was 
able to look back upon a writhing body, which was no 
longer his own, and to experience, above pam, a bliss 
proceeding from it — the bliss caused by a cool hand laid 
upon a fever, the hand being m this instance not an 
earthly one During the intervals between attacks he was 
without fear of their return They were of no more signi- 
ficance to him than the common processes of the body, 
and his desire for death was not now a desire to escape 
from them or from any affliction or wrong, but an eager-

ness for that perfecting of the contemplative life which, he 
was persuaded, was almost within his reach 
His strength was to look forward continually and to feel 
upon his lips that air of another world which, while he was 
unconscious on the island, he had seemed to breathe His 
peril was to look back, and to fortify himself in the way he 
was going, to teach himself to die, was his single purpose 
He found that, even now, an avoidance of earthly contacts 
and knowledge was contrary to his discipline To shut out 
the world was to begin to long for it with fears and hopes 
and curiosities not to be stilled, and he could not be at 
peace, or make any advance towards death, until certain 
facts were known, accepted and overpassed For this 
reason, when countrymen of his came from the Hague to 
visit lum, he received them gladly and would allow them 
to conceal nothing from him He asked for news and 
received it nearly always in silence, from which he would 
emerge at last to speak of other things But there were 
occasions on which his guard was broken down “Now it is 
too late,” he exclaimed once “We should have fallen back 
and fought on the Rhine We might have had terms 
there,” and when it was objected that this would have 
been to prolong the war without changing its result, he 
replied with a flash of anger “It would have saved the 
regime ” Disturbed by his wrath, he allowed his mind to 
return to the past, and, while the two Germans at his 
bedside argued without conviction that all was not yet 
lost, he remembered the September day of heat and storm 
on which, when Lewis and Julie had set out for the fire, 
he had remained m the library, overwhelmed by a solitary 
blackness of mood Bapaume had fallen and the line of 
the Somme was being abandoned Since the failure of 
Ludendorff’s offensive in March he had known within 
him that victory was impossible, now, while the nurse 
was bringing him tea, he had understood for the first time 
that defeat was certain But he had not guessed that the 
struggle would end before Christmas 
The fire had spread fast while he lay sick Now Bulgaria 
had gone, Scheidemann and Bauer were in Prince Max’s

government, a request for an Armistice had been dis- 
patched to Washington, the captured territory was to be 
abandoned His visitors had told him that the army itself 
was crumbling, to-day they had brought news that under 
a political amnesty Liebknecht had been set free 

His mind flamed with grief and indignation from which, 
after the Germans had gone, he was still unable to escape, 
and Lewis, entering the room, heard him exclaim “Moltke 
sent two corps to the Vistula on August 25 If they had 
been on the Marne a fortnight later to close the gap be- 
tween Kluck and Bulow, Pans would have fallen Even 
without them we ought to have stood ” And he repeated 
“Even without them — the flank couldn’t have been rolled 
up Bauer was wrong I was at headquarters in Luxem- 
bourg It was clear enough that Moltke and Bauer were 
wrong Moltke lost his head He sat there with his face 
white and his hand stretched over the table, curling and 
uncurling his fingers We others — who were we? — we 
could say nothing We couldn’t overrule him No one but 
the Emperor My God, what fools — and now ” He 
opened his eyes and saw, first, his own fingers curling 
and uncurling themselves on the coverlet, then, above him, 
Lewis standing in silence 

He considered the Englishman with dawning curiosity, 
thinking how strange it was that the face looking down on 
him should be, indeed, that of an Englishman, and that 
this face, more than any other, was welcome and had 
power to recall him from such heat and bitterness as had 
just now possessed him No secret divided them, their 
intimacy was far-reaching and tranquil, they could sit 
together for hours, sometimes talking, sometimes drifting 
away from speech into silences which, when they ended, 
seemed always to have been an agreed preparation for 
what had yet to be said 

“Will you tell me,” Narwitz asked, “what it is that 
makes you wish to be with me? I am glad when you come 
— always glad But you have another life outside this 
room ” 

“Yes, I have another life, but you have changed it ”

“In what way?” 

“It is hard to answer that,” Lewis said “But 

wouldn’t ” He hesitated “Wouldn’t any student of 

philosophy have come to Lazarus?” 

“To Lazarus? Because he was raised from the dead? 
But I can tell you nothing of the next world, Alison 
If you had been taken into a strange country before day- 
break and dragged back from it at the first hint of light, 
there’s little you could tell Some of that light has entered 
into my imagination, changing what I see ” 

“ ‘Changing what you see?’ ” Lewis repeated 

“Yes,” Narwitz answered “I can tell you a little of 
that Do you remember how, m Italy, early in the fifteenth 
century, the infusion of the Greek into the Christian 
vision changed the eye of certain painters, so that m the 
faces they painted, m the faces of Botticelli, for example, 
there appeared always a sadness which seemed to spring 
from a desire to participate in two separate and opposed 
existences? The women of Botticelli are beings of divided 
mmd or, I would rather say, of divided spirit Into their 
knowledge of earth, their love of it, their wish to cling to 
its sensible beauty, there enters the disturbing breath of 
aspiration They are aware of, but dare not accept, their 
kinship with the angels who whisper to them, and with 
reluctance, but under necessity, they turn away their 
heads They are saddened by visible beauty, even while 
they rejoice m it, because they perceive, shining distantly 
through it, another and absolute beauty, calling to them, 
but by them unattainable In the same way the infusion 
of the heavenly into the earthly vision changes the eye of 
him that experiences it, and he sees men and women, not 
as empty vanities, as some of spiritual pretension have 
claimed, nor as self-sufficient and responsible in reason, as 
the materialists will have it, but as beings whose domin- 
ating character is uncertainty — uncertainty of where they 
are and of what may be their true relation to their sur- 
roundings Seeing them thus, he can neither condemn 
nor pardon them, indeed, pardon and condemnation are 
ideas that have origin in human uncertainty and are with-

out final substance, nor, except as one pities the joy and 
energy of a child, can he pity them He is m a condition, 
as Botticelli seems to have been, in which pardon and pity 
and condemnation and all the judgements of philosophy 
are fused m wonder ” 

“In wonder?” Lewis said “Not m knowledge or under- 
standing^’ 

“It seems to you vague and indeterminate?” Narwitz 
answered “It would have seemed so to me a few weeks 
ago I too wished then to know and understand, I sup- 
posed that ignorance was what chiefly separated the mortal 
from the immortal state, and believed that death would be 
a door to secrets — that after it everything would be made 
plain Nor do I suggest now that greater knowledge and 
understanding are not attained to m the immortal state, but 
that they are the distinguishing essence of God I no longer 
believe What we have hitherto called omniscience is better 
thought of as an infinite power of wonder Knowledge is 
static, a stone m the stream, but wonder is the stream itself 
— in common men a trickle clouded by doubt, m poets and 
samts a sparkling rivulet, m God a mighty river, bearing 
the whole commerce of the divine mind Is it not true that, 
even on earth, as knowledge increases, wonder deepens?” 

“Then the purpose of a contemplative is to develop the 
faculty of wonder?” Lewis asked “Is that the imitation of 
God?” 

Narwitz smiled “Are you disappointed, like Naaman, 
that something more difficult is not required of you? It is, 
I think, difficult enough The soul hardens like the mind 
The mind, becoming set, excludes fresh knowledge, the 
soul excludes the wonder which is in God and m children 
and m the gentler saints The doctrine is not a new one ” 

And Lewis said “‘Whosoever shall not receive the 
kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter 
therein * ” 

He asked no more that day, but, feeling himself to be 
in the presence of one who was the brmger of gifts, he 
returned often to the subject and asked for guidance 
Narwitz answered that each man must find his own way,

that there was none prescribed “But what you have m 
your mind,” he added, “is the choice, always uppermost 
in the minds of men, between the acceptance and refusal 
of earthly love You know, as I have long known and as 
has been sufficiently proved to me, that all spiritual achieve- 
ment is, m essence, solitary Women, when we lie with 
them, look into our faces and ask what we were thinking 
of m the moment of sensual climax and in the succeeding 
moment of release They have seen isolation in our expres- 
sions, but they wish us to answer that it was of them we 
were thinking We may answer so, but it is not true The 
fact that we love them excludes them momentarily and 
gives us freedom, not from them only, but from our own 
bodily shells It is a very simple paradox that though, m 
that instant, we might remain conscious of a woman to 
whom we were indifferent — that is, remain earthbound by 
her flesh and our own, we escape in inexpressible wonder 
from a woman we love She has power to release us, that 
is all, it is a miraculous power 
“You see, just as we teach children to have good manners 
and to give place to others — in a word, to be courteous and 
self-denymg — so we, while we are m our philosophic child- 
hood, must be self-denying and must love But self-denial, 
though a great and necessary virtue, is a virtue to be tran- 
scended and left behind, and love also, for love is a dis- 
traction from personal unity — it prevents the coming to- 
gether of the soul Yet — and this is a deeper paradox — it 
is on earth necessary to the growth of the soul To reject 
it, while we are in a condition to require it, is to stunt our- 
selves with asceticism and to grasp at spiritual independ- 
ence before our time Love, a form of suffering, is, like 
pam and ambition and loyalty and all profound emotional 
experience, a form of discipline, being a part of life, itself 
a discipline, and like all earthly gams it is a designed 
prelude to loss When we know intellectually that loss is 
freedom, then we are philosophers, when loss has become 
freedom, then we are baptized m wonder and are fit to 
die Has the death of Jesus any other significance that is 
unchanging, whether he was human or divine?

“But I am tired,” Narwitz added “I shall be able to 
speak little more with you ” 

It was the last of his conversations with Lewis on the 
subject which had interwoven their lives Henceforward, 
though Lewis visited him often, Narwitz spoke little, 
having fallen back into himself His nurse and doctor had 
become hands and voices The Baron he could still wel- 
come, for the old man would talk to him of sport and the 
affairs of Enkendaal as if the blaze in Europe were of little 
account m the van Leyden generations, but the others — 
Allard, his wife, Manetje, Goof, the Baroness herself— 
were of a hopeful, persistent and ardent neutrality that was 
for him the clink of words The war, they assured him, 
had not been fought m vam, for there would be no more 
wars, Germany, reconstituted, would enter swiftly into the 
brotherhood of nations, the years to come would be years 
of healing and peace They added with the air of school- 
masters that the world had learnt its lesson 

Among them Sophie was an exception She was without 
complacency and did not speak of war Standing at the 
window, with her face turned away from him, she would 
talk of trivialities, twisting her hands, then go abruptly, 
always without having said what she had come to say But 
at last, unable to abandon the task she had undertaken, 
though suffering agony m the discharge of it, she did not 
go, and he became aware of her voice at his pillow, her 
agitated, fnghtened desperate voice, and of the sound of 
her breath She was pouring out her secret — that Julie had 
betrayed him, that she could prove it — could prove it, that 
she had known for months, that Ella had known “They 
have all lied to you 1 ” she cried “Alh Lewis as well ” There 
was something pitiable m her agitation, she seemed to be 
confessing a sm of her own that had sickened her con- 
science and corroded her mind, and when Narwitz, having 
brushed her tale aside as a thing not to be believed, laid 
his hand upon hers as though she were a fnghtened 
child, he knew that she was glad of his disbelief But she 
snatched her hand away and fell into reiterated accusations,

which he continued to disregard Suddenly she broke off 
and, covering her face, fled towards the door There she 
turned and confronted him, her eyes distended and her 
lower jaw moving laterally to and fro “Do you know what 
else they have hidden from you?” she cried “Do you know 
what else? Ludendorff has been dismissed There’s a mutiny 
at Kiel And now the Emperor has run away He is going 
to the Bentmcks at Amerongen He has left your army to 
fend for itself Do you disbelieve that? Do you think Pm 
lying now?” She swayed, watching him, waiting for the 
effect of her words, then, all the fierceness being suddenly 
emptied from her, she was filled with remorse, and tears 
began to flow down her cheeks At last, m terror of herself 
and of what she had done, she pressed her knuckles into 
the sides of her mouth, and twisted her head and shoulders 
away from him, and went out 

It became plain to Narwitz on the evening of that day 
that he had not long to wait On the lassitude following 
the next attack, he would go out as on a tide, and would 
go out alone The thought of frightened and embarrassed 
people gathered round his bed to watch him die was deeply 
repugnant to him He said this to Julie, and, when she 
asked whether she might not be with him at the end, he 
replied that they had already said farewell to each other 
and that he wished, if the nurse and doctor could be ex- 
cluded, to endure the final pang in solitude 

While the November days went by, it seemed to him 
that he lay in a womb, eager for the summons of birth 
His mind, though streaked with premonitions of the life 
he was about to enter, was deeply coloured by memories of 
the past Still he asked for news, and the spread of revolt, 
first to Hamburg, Lubeck and Bremen, then to Leipzig 
and Munich themselves, was admitted to him But the 
names of the Centre and the South fell away He had 
returned to the country and the marshes familiar to his 
childhood He was astride a great horse of his father’s, 
feeling the stretch of his legs and rocking m the saddle 
because he could get no grip on it He was out m the woods,

startling and delighting himself with legends, and making 
of each tree an adventure, endowed by his imagination 
with terrors and wonders Over his bed stooped again the 
promise of life, everything was fresh and shining, Nature 
had been made for him, the hush of evening and the last 
flight of birds were his, the hours, the days, the years were 
waiting for him only Even in sadness — and his childhood 
was not free from it — there was a springing emotion, an 
evidence of life, a pulse, and this pulse moved again m 
him now and he ached with longing for he knew not what 
— for an enchantment that was being woven for him 
alone, for a music that would be poured upon him from 
the air And there appeared before him a girl whose beauty 
charged him with power She gathered into herself his 
childhood and his old age, she absorbed his being and 
released him, as prayer released him, from the prison of 
his own individuality Gazing at the lamp beside his bed, 
he found it impossible to know whether she was of the 
past that he was leaving or of the future, into which, out 
of the darkness of this womb, he was to be born, in her, 
past and future were inseparable, she was his origin and 
his redemption And when, on the evening of November 
9, the womb in which he lay contracted upon him, and 
there was neither light nor breathing, and shrewd eyes 
were thrust into the core of his agony, he saw Julie among 
the eyes, and recognized her and stretched out his hand 
to her, for he and she were running together from pursuers 
through a brilliant wood She took handfuls of darkness 
out of a bag swinging at her hip and threw them behind 
her Soon they had shaken off their pursuers and were 
alone m the wood They fell asleep and, while he slept, 
he knew that she rose secretly and went away, but when 
he awoke she was beside him and her going away seemed 
to have been a dream 

But he was not m a wood and the curved slice of light 
on the clock-glass above the lintel told him that morning 
had not yet come The nurse was lifting him m his bed, 
there was a hiss from the cylinder of oxygen, and a smell 
of rubber and vulcanite was stronger than the soapy smell of

herhands “You were dreaming, ’’she said, and he answered 
“Whatever it was the dream has done me good,” for his 
mind was clear and he knew that very soon, perhaps before 
daylight, he would die But time passed The gilding on 
the clock began to glisten and footsteps passing his door 
told that the Castle was awake 
From a light hovering on the edge of consciousness, he 
awoke and asked the time It was eleven o’clock He asked 
where Julie was and was told that she and the doctor had 
just gone from the room He wished his wife and the 
English officer to come to him, he said, and to be left 
alone with them a little while 


When they were beside his bed, Julie on her knees with 
her face hidden m the coverlet and Lewis standing 
opposite her on his right hand, he touched her and said 
“You have loved each other?” 

She answered “Yes ” 

“With more than the body?” 

“With more than the body ” 

He breathed heavily and was silent Lewis searched his 
face in anxiety, but the long silence seemed not to be of 
exhaustion but of thought His head was unmoved but 
his eyes turned from one to the other 
“But not evilly — not evilly towards you Can you 
understand that?” Julie cried, looking at him with entreaty 
and interlacing her fingers with his “Neither he — nor I — 
knew you until you came back ” 

“It is true,” Lewis said “We did not know ourselves, 
I think, until your endurance taught us ” 

Narwitz withdrew his hand from Julie’s grasp and laid 
it upon her head, weighing down her head, as though he 
could not endure to look into her face and would have it 
hidden from him 

“I am not asking these questions in jealousy,” he said 
“From that agony I am absolved ” And afterwards, look- 
ing at Lewis he said “Nor do I hate you, Aiison, indeed, 
you are the last friend I shall make m this world Hatred 
and jealousy and possessive love, perhaps all earthly love,

among the few men living who understand that they are 
to be outgrown ” He drew m his breath with pain “And 
I have learned that there are experiences which quell 
them There are experiences,” he added with a smile, 
“which take the place of philosophy ” 

Julie stirred at his side, urging him to rest 
“I shall have time to rest/’ he answered, “and I would 
not rest m doubt Give me a few minutes m silence Then 
let me speak ” 

“Tell me one thing,” Julie said 
“What is it?” 

She straightened her body “Rupert, do you remember, 
long ago you said — long ago , m Germany, when we were first 

married, you said ” She could not speak Her fingers 

were locked in the coverlet At last, m a voice shrill but 
very small, she continued “You said to me ‘Into thy 
hands I commend my spirit 9 Have I betrayed you m that? 
In that, too?” 

“It was a charge,” he answered, “that you could not 
accept, for you never loved me ” 

“Until now ” 

A light entered his face He raised his hand a few 
inches, unsteadily, perhaps to cover his eyes, but the 
movement defeated his strength 

“Even that — is it possible — now,” he whispered and, 
relaxing the weak tension of his limbs, lay in an ivory 
stillness, an enchantment of memory being upon him At 
last he roused himself and for the first time moved his 
head, drawing down Lewis’s eyes to his own 
“I must be brief,” he said, “and say crudely what I 
have to say I shall not spare your feelings or my own 
Julie never loved me in the past with mind or body Since 
my return, she has pitied me and she has adored my 
suffering, as though I were other than I am and raised up 
on a cross You, too, have felt — friendship towards me for 
the same reason* 5 Is that true? But it is you, not I, 
who have made her capable of her pity and adoration She

me, thinking to give life to me But it has been her torment 
and penance It has been my torment also and my pen- 
ance ” He closed his eyes and continued “I see the past 
and the future clearly There seems to be no division 
between them Whether I shall continue in my own 
person — a separate consciousness — in another world, I do 
not know As to that, I have no faith to guide me But I 
shall continue here m your thoughts and lives, not as a 

cause of guilt ” He hesitated “Not as a cause of guilt 

but as an inevitable consequence ” 

“O Rupert,” Julie cried, “can you not forgive us?” 
“Forgive you and set you free? My Julie, forgive is a 
word for the gods, and freedom an attribute of the gods 
Here nothing is certain but fulfilment and consequence 
We sow and reap, and if we fail to reap our own harvest 
when it is npe, then afterwards we reap it when it is 
poisoned While we live, we must live our dreams There 
is no other way of passing beyond them into reality 
Come nearer to me It’s hard to see you Nearer, Julie, 
nearer And you, Alison, nearer ” 

A silvery pallor had touched his eyelids and was spread- 
ing like a curtain over the middle and the lower parts of 
his face “Do not leave me,” he said “It will pass ” Julie 
gave him water silently and waited 
“My dream,” he began, “was one that couldn’t be lived 
You were to replace every loss While you lived, nothing 
could die My friends, my country — all were poured into 

you When no help was left, you were my help Now ” 

A rigor shook him “I must make haste,” he whispered, 
and lay still 

Then, m a stronger voice, to Lewis 
“You love her You have made her She is the bridge 
to your own truth Will you guard and keep her?” 

And to Julie “My beloved one, there is no other way 
that is not barren We forgive ourselves m this world by 
working out our forgiveness ” 

And to both “Give me your hands That shall be your 
oath ” 

His hand lay upon theirs

CHAPTER ONE 

It was expected m Enkendaal that the Grafin von Narwitz 
would travel with her husband's ashes to Germany 
Allard and his wife, with Goof in support, shared this 
expectation and urged that Julie should be made to fulfil 
it “In Prussia they will expect her to go Certainly she 
must go,” Allard said “If we give way to her now, we 
shall always give way ” 

Julie, in a stupor of shock, neither consented nor re- 
fused She knew that by Rupert's death she had been 
made worthless to the van Leydens — to all of them except, 
perhaps, to Uncle Pieter, she had become for them their 
governess's daughter, Julie Quillan, no more, and she 
watched their cautious encirclement of her with an apathy 
that irritated them because they could not believe it to be 
sincere They could not hunt if the quarry would neither 
run nor fight, and they assumed resistance where there 
was none 

Julie was blinded by the flash of the past and the deep 
mists of the future For the present she did not care, nor 
for what became of her When she thought of her husband, 
she felt no grief, but only, as part of the emptying of 
her life, grief's absence, a tearless void, and Lewis, m 
her thought and m her brief encounters with him, was 
for her a being to whom she felt herself bound by ties 
the nature of which she dared not and could not consider 
“Give me time,” she said, “I cannot think or decide ” 

The contest over her going to Germany was fought out 
m her hearing on the day after the body had been cremated 
m Rynwyk

“It makes no difference to me,” she said, “whether I 
am here or there I should have thought that Rupert’s 
people would have been better without me They cannot 
want an Englishwoman ” 

“How can you say now that you are English?” Sophie 
demanded “Can’t you forget that stubborn, wicked 
arrogance — even now, when he is dead? In ashes, in this 
house You are wicked You don’t know the meaning of 
loyalty ” 

“But it is true that I am English,” Julie replied “Above 
all, to them And it was Rupert himself who sent me away 
from Germany ” 

“The more reason that you should have courage enough 
to return ” 

“I must say, I agree,” said Allard 

“It would be ” his wife began, and, failing to find 

the impressive phrase she was seeking, she concluded 
awkwardly “It would be the least we could do ” 

She looked at Goof who, staring first at Julie’s straight 
figure, upright m a chair, and afterwards cocking up his 
chm towards the ceiling, pronounced “The very least, 
I must say ” 

The Baroness, having perceived clearly since Narwitz’s 
death that all her battles for her daughter were to fight 
again, chose not to fight on this ground The journey into 
Prussia would be intolerable, she imagined the box con- 
taining the urn among Julie’s baggage, there would be 
disorganization everywhere, no porters, the girl would 
have to carry the thing herself The Leydens were fools, 
they had no imagination, but they were evidently de- 
termined Besides, to get Julie away now from Lewis 
Alison 

“ Julie has not refused to go,” she said “I’m sure, Pieter, 
that if you feel she ought to represent the family ” 

“Represent the family!” Sophie cried 

“Be quiet, Sophie' I was talking to your father ” 

“I will not be quiet I will not be ordered by you If 
you think that now, Julie ” 

“The thing is plain to anyone not mad,” the Baron

said “There is revolution in Germany And look at the 
child — she is worn out ” 

Sophie’s eyes were narrowed by her indignation “ ‘The 
child'”’ she exclaimed “Why must you take her side 
against your own family? Because you are a man, I suppose 
All men are fools and gluttons with her ” Her neck was 
thrust forward, the veins distended by passion, and her 
fingers were plucking at her black dress “Or are you so 
old and blind,” she cried with little clusters of bubbles 
forming at the corners of her lips and her voice rising at 
each word, “that you don’t know what she is and has 
been ” 

The Baron strode at her with both hands uplifted She 
withered like a stiff tree touched by lightning 

“Go from the room'” he cried “Go 1 ” And when she 
had gone, he said to the others “There will be no more 
of this, you understand? Why must you hate her so? She 
has done you no injury ” 

“They hate her,” the Baroness said to him privately 
that night, “because they hate me ” She wished to be 
assured by his reply that Sophie’s words had been for 
him no more than a raving, that suspicion of Julie’s 
fidelity to her husband had not been aroused in his mind 

He shuffled out of his slippers and climbed into his bed 

“You women must learn to live in peace,” he answered 
and thrust his face into his pillow 

She was long awake, considering wearily the battle she 
must fight Hearing her husband stir, she asked if he were 
awake 

“Yes,” he said “That affair goes on in my head 
Women’s voices should be quiet always They become 
devilish when they are raised ” 

“Sophie was beside herself You must not blame her 
too harshly ” 

He chuckled “It’s not often you plead for Sophie, my 
dear ” 

“But this is serious ” 

“Serious?” he echoed “I know but in what way 
particularly?”

She had his attention now Through the gloom she saw 
his head raised from his pillow, that he might hear better 
with his right ear 

“Just now, Sophie is scarcely responsible for what she 
says Particularly about Julie I don’t think you’ve ever 
understood how it is between them Men always forget 
that plain women can be hot-blooded too You see, Pieter, 
Sophie has been passed over and passed over ” 
“Nonsense She could have been married half a dozen 
times ” 

“For your name and money — yes She knows that 
That makes it the more bitter ” 

There was silence in the dark room Then she heard 
him fiddling with the watch on the table beside his bed 
Not wishing to appear urgent in her persuasions, she 
waited for him to speak 

“But that has always been so,” he said at last “Why 
this outbreak now? What concern has Sophie with 
Narwitz’s death?” 

It was the question she had hoped for 
“If he had lived, Julie would have been out of the way,” 
she answered “Now she is marriageable again ” 

“Then when Sophie said ” 

“There is nothing she may not say now to damage 
Julie,” the Baroness interrupted quickly “We must be 
prepared for that Fantastic things ” She held her breath, 
hesitated, decided “I believe Sophie has it m her mind 

that between Julie and Lewis Alison ” 

“Nonsense Nonsense anyway Besides,” he added 
thoughtfully, “Narwitz’s behaviour to them both puts 
that story out of court The three of them were deep 
friends That would have been impossible ” 

“Still,” his wife said, “there are people capable of saying 
anything” 

The old man turned over Across the gap between their 
beds she heard him drag the blankets round him and re- 
settle his pillow 

“They’d better not repeat such things to me ” 

She waited until he sighed the heavy, contented sigh

that told her each night when he had put his troubles from 
him 

“If Sophie speaks rashly, we mustn't be too hard on 
her, Pieter ” 

“No, my dear ” 

It was wise, she thought, that Sophie’s name should 
be m his mind as he fell asleep She could lie more quietly 
now, listening to his harsh, regular breathing, the danger 
that Sophie’s story might find him unprepared was warded 
off Insistence now would serve only to increase his un- 
belief How strange it was, she thought, returning to a 
subject which had long puzzled her, that Narwitz had 
never known 1 Couldn’t he read it m Julie’s eyes and more 
certainly m her touch? Perhaps because she had never 
loved him — perhaps, anyhow, the wretched man was so 
racked and obsessed, so desperately ill, that he was easily 
deceived But she despised him for having been duped 

She put the problem away from her It had ceased to 
be of importance, for the man was dead Enough remained 
to be thought of To get the Englishman away He and 
Julie had never had any intention of marrying, she felt 
sure, as long as Narwitz lived, they had been elaborately 
secret, they had taken their pleasure — she smiled toler- 
antly in the dark, inwardly applauding their worldly 
discretion — without any wild ideas of challenging the 
world and attempting an impossible match Now she was 
less certain of their wisdom The match was still impos- 
sible It would burden him, harass him m his work, and 
it would take her— the Baroness imagined Cheppmg, 
almost a suburb now, she supposed Walking through 
mud to the station Mrs Alison grown old— sisters, vaguely 
seen, callers, the parish, the tradesmen’s books, she 
imagined Julie going into the kitchen every morning at 
ten o’clock An intolerable life for both of them, and if 
there were children 

Julie herself would have almost nothing, her settlement, 
after the revolution, would probably not be worth the 
paper it was written on and her dowry — there was a little 
in Rentes and Consols, but for the most part it was in

German land mortgages or in City of Moscow Bonds 
Nothing But for that reason the more, he might offer to 
marry her, and after such a scene as there had been to-day 
she might, m a fit of madness and loneliness, consent 
Anything to get away from Enkendaal 1 Sophie had always 
said that Julie would do anything to get away And once, 
without loving him, she had married Narwitz Now 
Still, the Baroness reflected, there’s one safeguard — 
passion must have lost its edge Passion, money, position — 
she felt more secure when she had discarded the incentives 
of which she recognized the power Loneliness and dislike 
of Enkendaal, though they might make a child lose her 
head, would not be enough to blind a girl of Julie’s ex- 
perience to the doom of an English middle-class marriage 
But though her reason quieted her fears, she herself had 
enough experience to distrust her judgement of Julie’s 
emotions She had never understood them She had 
wished to love the child and had failed, an everlasting 
division between them was the penalty of her failure 
There had been, moreover, something m Julie’s relation- 
ship with Lewis that had baffled her None of the blowing 
hot and cold, none of the violences that were to be looked 
for m those who, with a cautious eye on the world, were 
taking their pleasure secretly 1 She had said nothing, for 
there had been no other way but silence to guard the 
marriage, but she knew now intuitively that there had 
been a truth which had eluded her 

For a little while, she allowed the mystery to trouble 
her, turning it over and over in her mind, and wishing with 
all her heart that now — now with more urgency than ever 
before m their lives — she could break down the barrier 
between herself and her daughter If Julie would confide 
m her, would lay aside for a little while her steady hostility, 
then she could help her The Baroness, thinking of her- 
self now as Ella Hoek and not as the great lady she had 
become, looked back upon her life with mingled sadness 
and tnumph How she had fought for Julie — with what 
cleverness, with what success t And now, when Julie had 
failed and lost everything, how she would fight again — if

only Julie would play her part’ But Julie had always been 
ungrateful There had never been love or intimacy be- 
tween them since Julie had passed beyond a child's under- 
standing But perhaps, the Baroness thought, warmed by 
her own forgiving spirit, I may be able to soften her heart 
and guide her even now First, I will win her to me That 
I have never spoken of what I have known will prove to 
her that she can trust me Then we must be rid of the 
Englishman In any case, now that the Armistice is signed, 
he cannot stay m Holland long, and he must not loiter m 
Enkendaal 

Until she was re-established m the Castle, Julie must 
bide her time Bide her time, the Baroness repeated, but 
it must not be put to her m that way That would fire her 
She must not even be allowed to understand m what way 
I am working for her good 

She sighed over Julie's unreason and the ingratitude 
of children, but as she was falling asleep she remembered 
with satisfaction that, though Julie had lost all else that 
had been won for her, her youth and her beauty remained 
Germany now was useless, nor was a French son-m-law to 
be thought of, but m England Julie's slimness would be 
more appreciated than m Holland and, though she was a 
widow, there were Scottish noblemen who Now that 
the war was over it would be possible to travel again 
Clandge's would not be changed In dreams of London 
and Scotland, Ella Hoek passed hopefully into uncon- 
sciousness of the ingratitude and unreason of the world 


Inaction had served her well m the past, and for a week 
she relied upon it Soon the Englishmen would go from 
the cottage, though how soon neither she nor they could 
certainly tell Meanwhile, Sophie was hugging her know- 
ledge, aware that to attempt to use it in her father’s present 
mood would be to waste it If she waits too long, the 
Baroness thought, and the Englishmen leave Enkendaal, 
Sophie will miss her market 
Seeing this clearly, the Baroness was patient But she

itched for action, and every day that passed, every meeting 
between Lewis and Julie, enlivened the itch Their meet- 
ings were outwardly harmless and could not damage them 
m the eyes of the world, but what decisions were being 
made, or had been made, between them, she dared not 
guess She imagined that, without her knowledge, the 
ground might be crumbling under her feet Fear presented 
to her Sophie’s and Allard’s derision if Lewis were to go 
suddenly and Julie with him Julie, restless, weary, dully 
expectant, was capable of any folly 
“In the spring, Julie,” she said at last, “when it is pos- 
sible to travel, shall we go abroad together, you and I? It 
will make a break before settling down m Enkendaal again ” 
“I don’t think I can ever settle down m Enkendaal 
again,” Julie answered 

“But this is your home, my dear You have no other 
Now, let us think where we should like to travel I haven’t 
planned a real holiday for five years You shall choose I 
want to do what pleases you ” 

“I know, mother You have always thought of me — too 
much perhaps We may never have got on together, we’re 
differently made But I’m not ungrateful ” 

“Then, my dear ” 

“What, mother?” 

“Won’t you let me help you again?” 

“In what way can you help me?” 

The Baroness sighed “I can’t help you at all if you will 
not trust me You have reason to trust me, you know 
Another woman, who cared less for her daughter’s point 
of view — for her independence — might have behaved 

differently when she knew that ” 

“That Lewis was my lover?” 

“It was natural and forgivable m the circumstances 
of the war ” The Baroness touched her daughter’s hand 
with groping affection “I have been young myself ” She 
smiled, though she had little heart for smiling 
Julie withdrew from her “It was not for that reason 
you were silent, mother ” 

The Baroness made a little gesture of despair “My 



ch i THE END 385 

dear Julie, do you blame your mother for safeguarding 
your marriage?” 

“No, but it does not bring us nearer as human beings 
with understanding of each other ” 

“You are hard, Julie ” 

“We are both hard, mother, when we are together ” 

The little silence that fell between them included all 
their past Looking into it, the elder woman saw her 
struggle and her justification 

“You forget,” she said, “that I fought the Leydens, 
alone here, when you were a child To establish you To 
gam recognition for you To make you Sophie’s equal 
You forget all that ” 

Julie was standing by the mantelpiece in her mother’s 
own sitting-room — the room, she remembered suddenly, 
in which she had been taught Dutch when she was a 
child 

“No, mother, I don’t forget That’s what I’m grateful 
for But you were fighting the wrong battle as far as I was 
concerned And you’d fight it again You are fighting it 
again — now?” 

“If you have sense enough to help me ” 

Julie turned from the fireplace and looked down on 
the trim, proud figure seated on the sofa’s edge, striving 
to identify it with the mother she had known m England — 
the mother of her early childhood whom her father had 
worshipped Perhaps, she thought suddenly, as Rupert 
worshipped me — and with as little cause And her eyes 
filled with tears She tried to check them but could not, 
she had no wish to shed tears m her mother’s presence, 
but they overflowed from her eyes, her lip trembled and 
her throat burned And she saw the expression m the face 
before her change from astonishment to a flurried mingling 
of tenderness and gratification Her mother rose and took 
her m her arms The falseness, the absurd theatricalism, 
of her weeping m her mother’s arms struck her, but, 
though she was aware of the stiffness of her own body — 
the stiffness of a dressmaker’s dummy tipped forward on 
its stand — she had no power to resist The warm drops

were drying on her cheeks Her mother was making low, 
clucking noises m her ear 

She broke free with a wrench of her shoulders and an 
instant later was regretting the petulant violence of her 
movement 

“O Julie 1 ” her mother said, twisting her ringed hands 
together as a cottage-woman twists her apron in em- 
barrassment and grief “Julie, dear, what have I done 
that you can't bear me to touch you even when you 
cry ? ” 

“I wasn't crying I wasn't crying,” Julie said, and, 
sitting down, curled her body away, hid her face in the 
back of her chair and sobbed as though her heart would 
break 

The Baroness also sat down, took out her handkerchief, 
and waited 

Soon, dry-eyed, they were gazing at each other, while 
a great Persian cat twined itself to and fro between them 

“I'm sorry, mother I didn’t mean to be brutal I ” 

“Now, listen, Julie Since, as you say — and as you 
prove, we are hard when we are together, let us at any 
rate see things as they are You say like a schoolgirl that 
you can never settle down m Enkendaal again Where else 
are you going, tell me that? You have pocket-money that 
came to you at your father’s death Apart from that you 
have little — probably nothing You are a pensioner here 
whether you like it or not ” 

Julie did not answer The Baroness went on “Very 
well You must make your bed if you are to lie m it Apart 
from myself, you have one friend m the world — your 
step-father You have been nothing but trouble and 
expense to him, but he likes you, there it is But if he 
knew what you had done, he would wash his hands of 
you Mr Alison was his guest, you were under his pro- 
tection, your husband was at the war You know your 
step-father’s code of honour well enough ” 

“If it is true,” Julie said, “that he would ‘wash his 
hands of me,’ it is useless, mother, for you to fight any 
more Sophie will tell him ”

“He will not believe Sophie I have seen to that,” the 
Baroness answered with pride “I am not a fool, my 
dear But there is one thing,” she added, “that might 
lead him to believe Sophie Mr Alison ” 

“He is going,” Julie said 

“But when?” 

“Soon ” 

The Baroness leaned forward “It is folly — the deepest 
folly — to keep him here, Julie To be seen with him To 
walk with him publicly Your step-father isn’t quick m 
his suspicion Still ” 

“But we have walked and ridden together for nearly 
two years,” Julie said, suddenly roused from her listless- 
ness by perceiving, m her mother’s argument, an illogical 
twist which suggested that she was not speaking all her 
mind 

The Baroness also was aware of the weakness in her 
own case as she was forced to present it She could not 
confess that, m getting rid of the Englishman, she was 
less concerned for her husband’s suspicions than for her 
daughter’s rashness Too late, she began to regret that 
she had spoken to Julie of Alison’s going She should have 
tackled the man himself But something m Julie’s face, 

? [uickemng her fears, impelled her to continue At least, 
ulie herself might be tested 

“It is different now that your husband is dead,” she 
said vaguely “In any case, it is wise to be on the safe side 
You would lose nothing by his going All that was over 
long enough ago ” 

“In a sense, it was over,” Julie answered 
“In a sense? It was over or it was not ” 

“If you mean that we have not — that he has not been 
my lover since Rupert came back — that is true ” 

“Then what did you mean — ‘in a sense’? There is 
no other sense,” the Baroness persisted with deliberate 
stupidity, and waited for the confirmation of her fears 
Julie rose “I don’t know what I meant, mother Does 
it matter so much? I suppose we were m a kind of en- 
chantment — and this is the real world, that’s all ”

Her mother hesitated, searching the girl’s face, alarmed 
but wishing to discover reassurance m it 
“Then remember that it is the real world,” she said 
“And m the real world a penniless widow needs a back- 
ground ” 

“A background?” 

“Ah, Julie, do not pretend to misunderstand me What 
else can you do — be a secretary? A governess? You would 
despise that You cannot live here, a single woman, for 
ever And if your step-father should die and Allard 
succeed to Enkendaal — besides,” she added, softening her 
voice, “there is no reason that you should not some day be 
happy again ” 

“Or make you happy again,” Julie said, stung to bitter- 
ness by the nagging futility of the scene she had passed 
through 

Her mother rose beside her They stood facing each 
other, while the cat still fawned upon their shoes 
“You are a fool,” the Baroness declared, her tone rough 
and stifled “You are the kind of fool that will not know 
herself Have you the idea m your head that your marriage 
was all of my making? You were ready enough to take the 
profits while they lasted ” 

Julie was silent 

“You think you were a child, coerced,” her mother 
exclaimed, shaking with indignation now as she had long 
ago over the stubbornness of a pupil, and breaking away, 
m her anger, from the control she had by careful training 
imposed upon her voice “You tell yourself that now — to 

flatter your romantic vanity, but the truth is ” 

“I was not coerced,” Julie answered quietly “But I 
was a child ” 

“Child or no child, coercion or not, you would do it 
again,” the Baroness cried “You will do it again when I 
have prepared the way There is nothing else you can do 
And when you want a new lover, you will blame me for 
havmg forced you into a rich marriage And be glad to 
blame me And be glad to blame me 1 ” she repeated

weight had been lifted suddenly from her mind, she 
turned and laughed — a short, low-pitched laugh 
“You will never marry a poor man,” she said “Never ” 
When Julie was gone, she sat down, trembling, and 
pulled the cat on to her lap She rubbed her cheek against 
the fur of its head, feeling outcast and ill I meant to help 
her, she thought, and began to cry The cat flicked its 
ears and sprang free on to the hearth-rug, where it lay 
washing itself 



CHAPTER TWO 

The Baroness came downstairs next day with her decision 
made At ten o’clock she walked over to Kerstholt’s 
cottage Ramsdell admitted her and took her to the upper 
sitting-room where Lewis was 

He was leaning against the window-frame with a book 
m one hand With the other he was crumbling bread from 
a platter that stood on a low bookshelf The eyes he raised 
from his page when Ramsdell spoke to him were bright 
and animated — so bright that she wondered for an instant 
whether he was m a fever After a slow recognition — for 
the light of the window had been in his eyes and she was 
m shadow — he came towards her 

“I hope I am not interrupting your breakfast,” she said 
He seemed not to be aware that there was anything 
unusual in munching dry bread at ten m the morning or 
to be embarrassed by the disorder of his room, which was 
burdened with books and papers 

“I was reading,” he answered, looking about him 
Then, seeing the bread “I eat when I’m hungry ” 
Ramsdell left them together and the Baroness, observ- 
ing Lewis, thought with satisfaction He is all books I 
needn’t have come, but she pursued the purpose of her 
coming He listened to her in silence, giving her no assist- 
ance by any comment o* his, and before she was done she 
had changed her opinion, though not her dislike, of him 
Never before had she encountered so formidable a silence 
There was neither threat nor defiance m it — only an im- 
penetrable composure

“When do you wish me to go?” he said at last 
“I am sure you will understand, Mr Alison, that it is 
better for Julie’s sake that you should go at once ” 

She knew that she would have been wise to press him 
no further, but she heard herself rattling on into hints — 
delivered with an admirable tact and discretion — that the 
Kerstholts were not owners of the cottage, but tenants 
and dependants of the Castle, and that in so small a com- 
munity as Enkendaal, the Castle — but her implied threat 
of eviction produced no effect on Lewis It was as if she 
had attempted to beat down or divert a flame by throwing 
pebbles that passed through it She looked round the room, 
feeling that she would long remember having visited this 
Englishman whom nothing touched 
“Does Julie know of your coming here?” he asked 
“I did not think it necessary to tell her She is troubled 
enough, poor child What is past is past She has to begin 
her life again That is what I wanted to make clear to you, 
Mr Alison I felt sure that you would not be so selfish or 
thoughtless as to make her way more difficult You see, 
while you were living m the Castle, while the war con- 
tinued, everything was exceptional ” Her voice ran on, 
beyond the rule of her will Watching him, she understood, 
with an unwilling understanding that wrenched at her 
self-respect, why Julie had accepted him bodily as her 
lover, and she found herself wondering whether m this 
disordered room, this cottage room where the window- 
light shone upward on to the triangular planes of the 

sloped ceiling, Julie had ever permitted The word 

“permitted” gratified her While she spoke to Lewis, she 
allowed it to echo m her mind It was a contemptuous 
word that might be used of a lover who was a peasant or 
a footman 

“You see,” she was saying in a tone of shrewd, mincing 
affability, “we must accept the world as it is Your position 

and Julie’s ” Under her words, the thought persisted 

that a man who could sit up all night over his books, and 
read standing, and eat dry bread like a serf, who yet had 
beauty and repose and power, was a menace, a pest She

hated him because he would not defend himself He did 
not care for her argument, though he attended it, or for 
her taunts, though he understood them He seemed not 
to be within her reach 

Going out, she said “Well, Mr Alison, we are agreed, 
I hope?” 

“Whether I stay or go,” he replied, “is of no importance 
to me and probably or none to Julie ” 

“If you will take my advice, you will put Julie altogether 
out of your mind,” she answered, and, the words coming 
to her from the past, she added “That was a kind of en- 
chantment, shall we say? This is the real world ” 
Instantly his expression was altered “Julie herself 
might have said that 1 ” he exclaimed eagerly and she knew 
that he was searching her face for resemblances to her 
daughter, searching it with a compelling, fiery tenderness 
that made her feel that he had passed through and beyond 
her, as though she herself did not exist 
“The man is mad 1 ” she said to herself, as she walked 
down the lane outside the cottage It rankled in her mind 
that he did not eat regular meals like normal people but 
munched dry bread, standing, at ten o’clock m the morning 
Seeing Kerstholt in the lane, slowly returning home, 
she said 

“You will not have your English tenants long, Kerstholt ” 
“Now that the war is over, Mevrouw No, I suppose 
not,” he answered, standing cap in hand “They will be 
glad to be home, poor young gentlemen ” 

“Mr Alison will be going at once,” she said 
He opened his eyes at that “But they told me only last 
night, Mevrouw, that ” 

“I have seen him this morning,” she insisted, wondenng 
even as she spoke, why she had paused to speak to Kerst- 
holt “I think he will be going at once The other may 
stay a few dajs perhaps ” 

She enjoyed the puzzlement m Kerstholt ’s eyes, know- 
ing that her power was the key to it, and her joy was 
sharpened by seeing across his shoulder, near the entrance 
to Allard’s house, Sophie’s narrow figure, wrapped m fur

and moving across the muddy road like a fastidious cat's 
There was a handkerchief rolled into a ball under her 
fingers and to her own surprise she let it run in the breeze 
and waved to Sophie Sophie’s hands stayed m her muff, 
but the thin oval of her face twisted m her coat collar 
When she reached the Castle, the Baroness was tired 
In the hall she met Julie and was envious of her There 
was colour m the girl’s cheeks, and her body, under its 
black dress, moved with spring and suppleness They did 
not speak and Julie went upstairs — to her own bedroom, 
no doubt The Baroness watched her go Well, she thought, 
he won’t go that way again 1 She ripped off her gloves Her 
nails were blued by cold and, there being in the hall no 
one to observe her, she dipped four of her finger-tips into 
her mouth and began to suck them 



CHAPTER THREE 


Sophie, not unobservant of signs of panic m her step- 
mother, had been content to wait The possibility that 
Julie might run away with Lewis was present in her mind 
also, and she was unalarmed by it Julie would rum herself 
and be gone, her mother would be humiliated, three birds 
with one stone Sophie’s ambition had swelled with time 
She wanted not so much the rum of the governess’s 
daughter, for whom she had indeed an obscure, envious 
admiration, as the humiliation of the governess herself 
She wished to rule Enkendaal for her father as she would 
have ruled it if he had not married a second time To 
persuade her father of Julie’s intrigue was not enough, 
she must persuade him that his wife had known of it and 
protected it — that she was, and that the world knew her 
to be, a procuress m effect “A procuress,” Sophie whis- 
pered m her obsession The word would cut when the time 
came to use it 

Why had that handkerchief been brought out and 
waved? Ella was not accustomed to wave to her There 
was no other cottage but Kerstholt’s in the lane at the 
entrance to which Ella and Kerstholt had been standing, 
it led nowhere but into sludgy fields, therefore she had 
been visiting Lewis She had not awaited his coming to 
the Castle, whither he would certainly come durmg the 
day, but had gone to him before eleven o’clock m the 
morning She disliked him, she had said often enough 
that the Englishmen m their cottage lived like peasants, 
though they dressed up and pretended to be gentlemen 
when they came out of it, the call was not made for 
pleasure or without purpose

Sophie sought for this purpose in vam She felt that it 
must be clear enough, but so eager was she to discover it 
that she could not Her head ached that afternoon with 
such violence that she whimpered on her bed and pressed 
the mountains of her thumbs into her eyes The darting 
agony in her temples and crown was so intense that at 
last, unable to be still, she rose, trotted across the room 
with the childish toddle that came naturally to her when 
she was alone and in distress, and rubbed her forehead 
and even the top of her head (pulling the hair apart) 
against the cold window-pane This comforted her a little, 
and she began to wonder as she often did when her head- 
aches were bad, whether she might not turn into a child 
again instead of becoming old 

While, m her mind, she was choosing the clothes she 
would put on if she awoke one morning and found that 
she was a child, she saw Ramsdell cross the bridge between 
the lakes and approach the Castle In less than ten minutes 
he came out with Julie at his side They went to the boat- 
house, crossed the bridge, and disappeared, through the 
thicket where the pavilion was, in the direction of the 
cottage Lewis had sent for Julie Why had he not come 
himself * 5 


“Leaving EnkendaaP Not to come back' 5 ” Julie had 
asked when Ramsdell delivered Lewis’s message He 
replied that Lewis would go to the Hague, or perhaps to 
Rotterdam, m readiness to take ship for England “Then 
this is the last time I shall see him,” she said 
As they walked through the grounds of the Castle, they 
spoke little, and when Ramsdell asked her “Is it to be the 
last time, Julie' 5 ” she turned her face from him and could 
not answer 

Lewis took her into a room downstairs, for the upper 
sitting-room, he said, was littered with his packing, but 
it was the upper-room that was familiar to her and she 
felt isolated and chilled, as though he and she were on a 
stage, ignorant of their parts, or had met by chance in a

waiting-room with nothing they could say to each other 
The same constraint was upon him, and though he spoke 
tenderly and touched her with the same gentleness which 
long ago had struck fire mto her, there was no fire now 
between them — only the burden of a frozen intimacy, the 
ache of an emotion emptied out 
When he told her of her mother’s visit, she replied 
“What my mother does can make no difference to us Go, 
Lewis, it’s easier We have nothing to gam by fighting 
her, and nothing to lose that she can take away ” 

“But you, Julie, what shall you do?” He was standing 
near to her and, though she did not look up, she saw, 
beyond her interlocked hands, that he was rigid and 
trembling Then, suddenly, in a jet of decision, he said 
“Come with me, Julie Together we can work out our 
lives, not apart ” To check the wild unrest m his own 
mind and to cover her silence, he allowed his words to 
run on “You are legally German It won’t be easy to get 
you to England at once But through the Legation it could 
be done, and shall be Come with me ” 

“To England, as your wife?” 

“Yes, Julie ” 

She smiled “Why do you ask me, Lewis?” 

“Because I love you,” he said “Whatever may have 
happened between us, we are part of each other’s lives 
More than ever now by ” 

“By a kind of necessity?” she answered “Yes, say it, 
Lewis Why should we be afraid of each other — to tell 
each other the truth? It is a necessity that binds us As 
though everything round us had died As though there 
were no one left m the world but our two selves ” 

“Is it no more than that, Julie? It is more to me Our 

love may be out of our reach now ” 

She grasped his hand “It is out of our reach,” she said 
“It is out of our reach — like something lying at the bottom 
of a deep pool We can see it and know it But we can’t 
move towards it We can’t recover it ” 

“And yet,” he answered, “we cannot leave it Cut off 
from each other, we shall never live again m this world

0 Julie, you and I — talking here, chilled by a memory of 
what we can’t feel — afraid to go forward, unable to go 
back And yet,” he continued, letting her hand fall, “we 
are what we were — you as beautiful — and I ” He 
walked across the room and returned to her “Nothing is 
dead, Julie, but sleeping — undergoing change What was 
shining and secret, our own, has become his, until we 
make it our own again The joy and the brilliance have 
gone from it It is bound up in suffering — his and yours 
and mine It’s dark and heavy — but it is alive Without it, 
you and I are thrown away ” 

“I believe that,” she said, “but I feel nothing ” 

“Then ” 

But she would not let him continue “You are making 
yourself speak of love for my sake, Lewis You have 
burdens enough In England you have your own struggle 

1 have no decision left Perhaps, some day, we shall be 
together again I don’t know ” 

“Come now,” he repeated, “come now, or give me your 
word to come 

She was silent a long time 

“Lewis,” she said, “try to believe and forgive me I 
know that I love you and shall not cease, but now I feel 
nothing For so long we have thought of him only, of 
saving him And we have failed It is as though you and 
I had been struggling and struggling up a mountain and 
had fallen back suddenly into the valley And you say 
‘Come now Climb again Another mountain Climb it 
blind ’ We are to set out, with no illusions, starved and 
tired, to struggle again I can’t Lewis I can’t now I can’t 
think or feel ” 

“But when time has passed?” 

“I can’t even give you my word,” she said “I love you 
— that’s true still But I’m cold and tired I don’t trust my 
own word Something has died m me And m you it 
has died,” she added, “in you too The enchantment has 
died ” 

“All enchantments die,” he said “Only cowards die 
with them ” He lifted up her face, and into his she saw

the old calm returning “Come when you will, Julie Life 
will begin again ” 

He released her and walked with her towards the Castle 
Suddenly she looked towards him, hesitated, and said, as 
though all her inarticulate truth might be expressed m 
the words 

“It’s just that Fm numb — and frightened, Lewis — 
that’s all Not a coward ” 

The curbed pleading in her tone and the failure of her 
words to match the dumb passion within her struck deep 
into his memory 

“You might have said that, Julie dear, when you were 
twelve years old ” 

She gave a little laugh, almost of happiness “It is true, 
then, that you love me,” she said “You wouldn’t have 
remembered ” 

When they reached the pavilion and were drawing near 
to the lakes, he stopped “It was here we met, Julie Shall 
we part here?” 

She gazed at him, feeling only the shutters of the past 
closing m upon her mind She was stiff, without tears 
They dared not touch each other, and she turned away 
and went on towards the bridge, determined not to look 
back, incapable of it Then, hearing him follow her, she 
turned He took her hand and bent and kissed it Her body 
began to tremble in ice and fire, and she exclaimed “But 
I made you kiss my hand when Ballater was here 1 ” For an 
instant she was stung with wild shame and joy, but when 
he was gone she could think only of the sound of the water 
flowing beneath the bridge and of the emptiness of her 
words There will be snow before night, she said, for she 
could read the skies m the colour of the water and the 
shrewd bleakness of the air 


That night, after dinner, Lewis came into the smoking- 
room of the Castle, not in evening dress, and wearing a 
rough overcoat powdered with snow Sophie pressed her 
knees together, curling her toes in her slippers Julie rose,

and stood without moving Her mother, elaborately un- 
aware that there was anything unusual in this visit, con- 
tinued to sew and asked Lewis to sit down “Tea will be 
coming in a moment ” 

“A cigar,” the Baron said “These are light Or a 
Havana?” 

“Fve come to say good-bye,” Lewis answered, “and I 
mustn’t stay I still have packing to do ” 

The Baron was nursing the cigar-box He looked 
up “Good-bye? Why so suddenly? Are you off to 
England?” 

“Possibly not at once, sir, but I have to go down to 
the Hague When I sail depends on ships and transport 
arrangements But I start from here early to-morrow 
morning I wanted to say good-bye and thank you for all 
you’ve done ” 

“Ah, nothing,” the Baron said “You’ve done more for 
me than ever I’ve done for you You’ll take your transla- 
tion of Dirk’s papers with you to England and arrange 
publication there?” 

“Yes, certainly I will ” 

The Baron stood up and took his hand “Well, Alison, 
you’ve learnt something of how the Dutch run their 
estates I shall miss you It will seem queer, always riding 
alone I shall have to take Julie with me She’ll miss 
you, too, reading and so on We shall all miss you We 
shall often meet again no doubt Still, it’s always a trifle 
sad when something ends After all, it has been an interval 
m life, eh? Things may be as good or better, but they 
won’t be the same again ” 

“No,” Lewis said, and pressed the old man’s hand, and 
could say no more 

There was silence and a clink of decanters 

“Is Mr Ramsdell going too?” Sophie asked 

“Not at once He’ll stay and clear things up at the 
cottage There’s more packing than I can do ” 

“Strange that they should send for you and not for him 
Aren’t you on the same file so to speak?” 

“Probably not,” Lewis answered “I’m Naval Division

He’s a submarine officer R N We didn’t come into 
Holland together ” 

That was clever of him, Sophie thought 

The Baron turned away from the side-table, a glass and 
a brandy decanter in his hands, holding them up 

“Telegraphed for you, I suppose?” 

For an instant Lewis hesitated “Yes, from the Hague 
this afternoon ” 

They talked for a few minutes, Lewis being persuaded 
to take off his coat “I shan’t publish Dirk van Leyden 
myself,” he said “I scarcely know whether my firm’s 
alive or dead till I get home ” 

“Yes, I see that,” the Baron answered “You’ll have a 
tough struggle But it will come right, you’ll see It will 
come right when you have settled down to it ” 

“I hope so,” Lewis said “It will be a fight with precious 
few munitions ” 

He rose to go He shook hands with the Baroness 

“Good-bye,” she said “I hope you have a pleasant 
journey ” 

He came to Sophie herself and when he touched her 
she curled her toes again inside her shoes He went to 
Julie 

“Good-bye, Julie, until we meet again ” 

She had not moved while he was in the room Suddenly 
she leaned forward, put her hands on his arms, and kissed 
him 

“Good-bye, dear Lewis ” 

She was smiling as she stood away from him, holding 
out her hand 

The Baron chuckled “That’s the way for old friends 
to say good-bye,” he exclaimed, and drew her arm into 
his own 

Next morning Sophie went into the post-office, bought 
some stamps and a bag of sweets that she gave to the 
postmistress’s child, and began to spin the weights of the 
balance on the counter 

“That telegram from the Hague yesterday for the 



ch iii THE END 401 

English officers at the cottage — it was long in being de- 
livered Wasn’t there anyone you could send up with 
it?” 

“Telegram? What telegram, Freule?” 

Sophie went from the post-office to the cottage, which 
she approached from the meadows behind it, and found 
Kerstholt working in his back garden 

“You will be sorry to lose the English officers, Kerstholt 
Mr Ballater made the front look pretty with his flowers ” 

“Yes, Freule But we still have his flowers You’ll see 
next spring The others were nice gentlemen too My 
wife was only saying last night how quiet they’d always 
been She was nervous at first at the notion of having 
them Strangers — Englishmen too She didn’t take to the 
English after the affair in South Africa But she was sorry 
to see Mr Alison go We were out, both of us, to wave 
him good-bye ” 

“It was very sudden, wasn’t it?” 

“That it was, Freule We didn’t rightly understand it 
Only the night previous Mr Alison was saying ‘It will be 
some time yet, perhaps a fortnight and more ’ And the 
next I knew was in the morning Mevrouw van Leyden 
met me m the lane there Mr Alison was going, she says 
So I asked him He’d let me know, he said Then the 
Freule Julie came up, and afterwards he came asking for 
his packing-cases that we had stored m the shed ” 

“He had a telegram during the afternoon,” Sophie 
suggested “That was it ” 

Kerstholt looked at her Evidently he didn’t know what 
the English officers had been up to He would be discreet 

“That must have been it,” he agreed 

Sophie went down to Allard’s house He and his wife 
were doing accounts together by the fire, and were irri- 
tated by her coming It pleased her now to waste time, to 
watch their bored faces 

“Well, Sophie,” said Allard, his patience deserting him 
“You see we are busy ” 

How it delighted her to see their faces change when 
she began to tell them what she knewl Julie had been

Lewis’s mistress — for months, for more than a year And 
Ella had known, had allowed it 

“But why did you say nothing if you knew?” Manetje 
asked 

Sophie had expected this question but was annoyed 
that, when nothing but eagerness for action was m her 
own mmd, she should have to pause to answer it There 
were so many answers, and to the chief of them — that she 
had been afraid of humiliation and ridicule — she would not 
confess How often, she remembered, had she laid plans 
for trapping Julie, and how often had she failed to carry 
them out 1 Though she had been convinced beyond all 
doubt m her own mmd that Lewis went often to Julie’s 
room, she had never been certain on any particular night 
that he was there He came and went always through the 
library and it was his known custom to work at night To 
meet him at any hour between the library and his bedroom 
was proof of nothing Once she had knocked at Julie’s door, 
and after a time a sleepy Julie had opened it and led her 
in What had she wanted? Her explanations had stumbled 
and fallen, a smiling Julie had led her out A dozen times, 
having crept into the library and found it empty, she had 
stood before the door of Lewis’s own bedroom and failed m 
courage to knock Once, softly turning the handle and find- 
ing the door locked, she had tapped gently, persuaded that 
the room was empty, but had not dared to force the alarm 
And she remembered, with a fluttering of her heart, the 
night on which she had found the door ajar Ah* at last he 
had forgotten to lock it Downstairs she had crept, through 
the drawing-room, through the ante-rooms, through the 
banqueting-hall at the base of the tower, up the staircase 
to the library No light showed under the door She had 
raised the latch and entered Inside — darkness and silence 
She had been certain then, she had her proof All that was 
necessary was to bar the door leading upward to Julie’s 
room so that none might return by it, then to go to her 
father, and she had been groping her way across the library, 
for m her wanderings through the Castle she earned no 
light, when Lewis himself had risen up m the faint gleam

of an embrasure and had asked what she did She was 
looking for a book, she had said, and had been unable to 
think of the name of any book but the Bible 
Her tormented memory of these things ran on while she 
was telling Allard and his wife, with what assurance she 
could command, that she had been biding her time She 
told them, m terror of provoking their laughter, as much 
as she dared tell of her nocturnal Sittings “It was useless 
to try to prove anything while Ella was on her side,” she 
concluded “Who would have believed me? Father would 
have been too surprised and angry to believe You saw 
how he behaved the other day ” 

“You might have told us,” Allard said 
“Not until I was sure Not until I was sure,” Sophie 
repeated “I was waiting ” And she added in proof “I did 
tell Rupprecht ” 

“You did tell him 1 ” cried husband and wife together 
“Well?” 

“He smiled ” 

“He didn’t believe you?” 

“That’s what’s so odd,” Sophie answered with a sigh, 
running her fingers across her forehead “I have always felt 
that he did believe me — secretly And yet he can’t have 
done, I suppose I don’t understand But it’s different 
now,” she added, speaking rapidly and with decision “Ella 
sent Lewis away She concealed it from father She let the 
he about the telegram pass in father’s hearing Why did 
she send him away? Because he had been Julie’s lover and 
she knew it Because she knew Julie might become his 
mistress again — or his wife There can be no other reason ” 
Sophie was disappointed by the effect of her story on 
Allard He believed it but was cautious “You ought to 
have told us long ago,” he said, “instead of hugging it to 
yourself You’re hysterical, Sophie — running about the 
house at night alone It’s just a question now whether we 
can surprise Ella into giving herself away She’s made it 
awkward for herself We’ll get Goof over from the Huis 
ten Borgh ” 

But Goof was in the Hague and did not reach Allard’s

through the snow to question Kerstholt and the post- 
mistress He sat late with Goof on the night of his coming,

ground again After luncheon, at a time when they knew 
the Baroness would be sitting m the smokmg-room, toast- 
ing her feet and reading the Handelsblad , Allard, a little 
nervous because he was attacking his former governess, 
and Goof, a little embarrassed to find himself a guardian 
of morals, were led by two women, who laboured under 
no such handicaps, across to the Castle The snow was

squelching of their own feet Goof was irritated by the

Julie had lunched with her mother alone — the Baron 
having ordered cheese and claret in his office — and had 
afterwards gone with her into the smoking-room The 
long, high-ceilmged room was darkened by its verandah 
which, though pleasantly used in summer, was now but a 
shoot for the thawing snow From time to time a wedge 
of snow would become detached, rush with the sounds of 
a broom and a muffled drum over the roof, and fall, hissing, 
into the laurel bushes 

“Don’t roam about, Julie There’s nothing to see from 
the window that we haven’t seen a thousand times before 
Throw some logs on the fire and be comfortable Would 
you like a sheet of the Handelsblad } ” 

Julie seated herself at a little distance from the fire, in a 

E osition from which she could see the silvery sky and the 
are tree-tops above the laurels She heard the moisture 
whistle m the logs and their bark peeling away, tranquil 
sounds that plumbed her own tranquillity The shining of 
the laurels and the afternoon twilight of this familiar room 
had fallen into the past Nothing that happened here could

though at a portrait on the wall, part of a vanished existence 

After a little while she rose from her chair 

“Where are you going, Julie?” 

“To my music-room ” 

“Isn’t it bad for you, dear, to be alone so much, cooped 
up in the tower?” 

In the hall she encountered the four who had come from 
Allard’s house, and, looking down upon them from the 
staircase, was reminded of the mixed choir that had visited 
her home m Cheppmg at Christmas-time The little group 
m black, facing inward in consultation and — for some 
reason that she could not guess — embarrassed, might have 
been about to sing a carol The idea that Sophie and 
Allard’s wife would lift up their chins and voices amused 
her Goof caught her smiling, smiled back, sheepishly, and 
looked away Before she was at the head of the staircase 
she had forgotten them, and in her room, with a quiet mind, 
she began to play her clavichord 



CHAPTER FOUR 

At the sound of the opening door, the Baroness withdrew 
her feet from their comfortable extension before the fire 
and looked over the back of her chair This was her hour 
of ease, soon she must go upstairs to rest, an exercise 
which, beneath the repairing hands of her maid, was more 
strenuous than its name, meanwhile she enjoyed the fire’s 
warmth on her outstretched legs She enjoyed, too, the 
twilight of the room which at about three o’clock had made 
her reading of the newspaper difficult Since then she had 
lam m her chair for a quarter of an hour gazing at por- 
traits of her husband’s ancestors, the need for effort lulled 
to sleep m her mind 

But she did not expect to be disturbed during this time 
of unguarded peace wherein all memories were softened 
and all ambitions laid away The appearance of Allard’s 
bulk round the leather screen by the door irritated her 
When she saw by whom he was accompanied — the full 
Leyden muster — a streak of fear ran through her body 
Perceiving danger, she called up the reserves of her pride 
and skill, but they also were lulled to sleep and did not 
answer Allard’s wife would trap her into some trifling 
display of social ignorance — the families of Holland and 
their connexions through Europe were so hard to re- 
member She had learnt them once, but they were for 
ever changing And Allard’s wife would smile and correct 

her “Ella, dear, surely you remember ” Or they 

would chatter among themselves of books she had not 
read, and turn to her suddenly for an opimon, knowing she 
could not give it — they whom she had taught “There is

no need for you to teach me!” she exclaimed once — 
foolishly, she saw afterwards, for Sophie had been quick, 
quick “Well, you had your turn when we were children,” 
she had answered They would tease her and taunt her, 
she knew Generally she was a match for them all But 
now she was tired They would laugh at her, and so have 
her at their mercy There was nothing she could do but 
escape, and she rose with careful slowness, that they might 
not guess she was running away, and said that she had just 
been going to her room A little flicker of humour prompted 
her to add “Are you going to play cards, the four of you? 
You must ring for candles and have the fire made up ” 
“Could you spare us a few minutes 15 ” Allard said 
“Why, yes ” But her voice would not ring with surprise 
“I hope nothing has happened ” 

“Fm afraid something rather serious has happened ” 
“Nothing to Pieter’” she made herself exclaim, but 
again her tone was false She knew that Sophie had shot 
her bolt 

“Oh no, Father's all right,” Allard replied 
He and Goof seated themselves on the fender His wife 
— always to be thought of as Allard's wife, never as 
Manetje, a diminutive that sounded ridiculous whenever 
it was applied to her — took a chair and planted a hand on 
each knee Sophie stood apart, a thin black tree growing 
out of the carpet, swaying a little but rooted 
Allard cleared his throat “No doubt you’ll be able to 
explain,” he began “But it’s very unpleasant — extremely 
unpleasant for all of us In all our interests — not just our 
own, I mean, but the family’s — it is absolutely necessary 
to clear her character ” 

“Oh, begin at the beginning, Allard,” his wife ex- 
claimed “There’s no going back on it now You can’t say 
what you have to say and be polite Besides, Ella knows all 
about it You’re telling her nothing she doesn’t know and 
ought not to be ashamed to know ” 

“Say that again ” They looked up like foolish children 
to see the Baron a few yards within the room, his crested 
hair and white collar breaking from the distant shadows

“Say that again please, Marietje Whose character is to be 
cleared, Allard? What ought my wife to be ashamed to 
know?” He came down to the fire and stood m its glow, his 
shoulders up, his arms stiffened, like an angry wooden 
soldier “What are you all doing here? What’s it all about?” 

Allard and Goof rose, Allard’s wife pursed her lips and 
began to rub her hands together 
“It’s nothing, Pieter,” the Baroness said “What brought 
you m here? I thought you were working away ” 

“My box was empty,” he answered, a boy with a 
grievance “I came m for a — I came in for a piece of string ” 
Whereupon Goof gave one short, nervous laugh, like 
the hoot of a solitary owl, and was silent 

“Yes, sir, you laugh You laugh like a fool ” 

“But why didn’t you ring your bell, my dear?” the 
Baroness said “Look, we’ll soon find you a piece of string 
In that brass box, Allard — behind you — on the mantel- 
piece ” 

“It’s always the same in this housed” his father said, 
patting the leather of an arm-chair to ease his impatience 

“You want something ’Tisn’t there Then ” His 

petulance overcame him “I couldn’t ring my bell because 
it’s broke Kapot ” 

This was too much for Goof He slapped his hands on 
his thighs and threw back his head as if he were about to 


enjoy the laugh of his life 

“Oh, don’t laugh, don’t laugh, don’t laugh 1 ” Sophie 
cried with impassioned seriousness “Have you all gone 
mad?” 

Allard was holding out a twist of string The Baron 
stared at it as if he did not know what it was, but he knew 
now that he had been led away from his track His eyes 
moved slowly from face to face 

“What is all this?” he said, enclosing the string m his 
fist 

After a long silence, Allard’s wife began “It has come 
to our knowledge ” 

“Excuse me I should like my son to speak Now, 
Allard ”

“All the time,” Allard said reluctantly, “all the time 
that Englishman, Alison, was supposed to be working m 
the library ” 

“He was working Why — ‘supposed to be’?” 

“Very well, sir All the time, he was — well, going up to 
Julie's room ” 

The Baron had control of himself now “Go on,” he said 
“Isn't that enough?” said Allard 

“You are saying that she was ” 

“Yes ” 

“You must say more than that, Allard This touches 
me He was my guest She is my daughter ” 

“Your daughter!” Sophie cried 

“Yes, Sophie I choose my own words I said, my 
daughter And you, Allard, mark that ” 

“Very well, sir I’m sorry But the truth’s the truth ” 
The Baron smiled, looking from Sophie to his wife He 
was not unprepared for this story Beneath his anger, he 
was a little pleased that Allard, and particularly Allard's 
wife, had been fooled 

“Now look here,” he said “Let’s not say what we may 
all be sorry for I know the origin of this lie No matter 
how I know, but I do Sophie told you — now didn’t she?” 
“Yes ” 

“And you accept that?” 

“Why not?” Sophie intervened “I was here I know I 
have known for months and months While it was going 
on ” 

Her father over-rode her “If she had come to me with 
it, I should have known how to treat such a tale But you, 
Allard — you have your head screwed on — and you come 
here ” 

“It doesn’t rest on Sophie alone ” 

“Then, perhaps you'll tell me how — how what you say 
—was possible? Och’ But it’s not worth talking of’” 

“But it was very possible and very easy,” said Allard’s 
wife “You think the staircase from the library to her 
bedroom has been closed up for years It hasn't been 
You can look for yourself ”

“Yes,” cried Sophie “Look for yourself The latches 
and bolts of both doors And the hinges ” 

He did not know how to answer that 
“That can be explained,” his wife said, but not before 
his confidence had been shaken “Julie opened up the 
wall-staircase when she came here at the beginning of the 
war so that she could go to and fro from the library to 
fetch books ” 

“I knew nothing of that,” he said 
“No, Pieter, nor did I at first But you know how reti- 
cent she is about her own affairs — a kind of game She 
told me later ” 

“When did she tell you?” asked Allard’s wife 
“Really, I don’t remember ” 

Sophie broke m “Was it after you knew what was going 
on?” 

“No It was ” She recovered herself, again too late 

“It was some time this year, I think ” 

“And did she close the staircase again when Alison 
began to work m the library at nights?” 

“I am sure she did ” 

“In June, two years ago!” 

“I suppose so ” 

“Look at the locks and hmges f ” Sophie exclaimed 
“Anyone can see they have been used more recently than 
that I will tell you when she closed the staircase again — 
when her husband came back ” 

The Baron had been waiting “Now, Allard,” he said, 
when Sophie was quiet, “anyone malicious — anyone 
malicious and hysterical — can monkey with locks and 
hinges What else have you?” 

Allard, who was himself beginning to wonder whether 
he had been duped and now wished with all his heart that 
he was at his own fireside, said nothing 
“Will you allow me to speak?” his wife asked 
The old man looked at her angrily “If you have any- 
thing useful to say ” 

She drew herself up m her chair “Allard has made a 
very serious accusation,” she began with formal calm

“For some reason he is tongue tied, he seems to have 
forgotten everything Very well, then, I must make it good 
This, as he said, doesn’t rest on Sophie alone or on hinges 
and bolts In the first place, you can use your own memory 
The way they went about together — nding, walking, 
always together In the library too No one else went there 

when he was working ” 

“I went continually,” the Baron remarked 
“Perhaps, but perhaps you were thinking of something 
else Perhaps your eyes are not very sharp for these thin gs ” 
“Pray God,” he said 

“None of your eyes seem to have been very sharp,” 
Sophie put m scornfully “You must have been blind, all 

of you Every time she looked at him or touched him ” 

“Let me go on, Sophie You do no good now,” Allard’s 
wife interrupted “But I will say this Sophie was living 
in the house We were not I thought it a disgraceful 
flirtation but I never dreamed of more I wouldn’t let 
myself But Sophie was living m the house, and although — 
well, although she may not be reliable in everything — 
she observed, she went about the house at night, she says, 

she’s not likely to have invented ” 

“Now listen, Manetje,” the Baron said, lrntated beyond 
endurance by her precise, explanatory sing-song “As for 
their going about together — they were both English, 
they’d known each other all their lives, he’d taught her as 
a child, they thought the same way — music and history 
and so on, and they were shut up here together D’you 
expect them to behave like strangers? Why, when he came 
in here to say good-bye to us, she kissed him in front of 

us all That doesn’t look like ” But, remembering that 

little scene, he saw it afresh, with new eyes I wonder* 
he thought, but he said swiftly “And as for Sophie’s being 
in the house — wasn’t her mother in the house too? You’ve 
all made a mistake and a shameful one That Allard should 
be shipped in this galley is what beats me Still, what 
happens m these four walls is our own There’s nothing 

gamed by shouting and railing ” 

“That’s the worst part of it,” Allard put in suddenly

“What is?” 

“Well, Ella, you see ” 

“Now wait a little, ” his wife said “Will you tell me 
something, Ella? You, of course, knew nothing of this?” 

“Nothing, of course ” The Baroness looked at her 
husband She felt that he was ceasing to believe her “But 
I have no intention of being cross-questioned by you, 
Marietje, about this or anything else The whole sugges- 
tion is shameful ” She began to rise from her chair, wish- 
ing only to escape 

“She’s afraid — afraid to answer,” Sophie jeered 

After all, the Baroness thought with hot indignation, 
there is nothing to fear I have only to deny everything 
They have no proof Her strength returning, she was 
filled with a desire to defeat and humiliate them They 
had no proof, none 

“This is enough,” the Baron began, evidently to pro- 
tect her, but she would not have his protection now, while 
doubt remained in his mind She would not run for 
shelter before them all 

“What more do you want to know?” she asked, and 
observed with satisfaction that even Marietje seemed to 
be moving stealthily towards conciliation 

“There’s very little more I want to know It is of course 
possible that Sophie was mistaken Were you never even 
suspicious?” 

“Never There was no reason to be ” 

“Apart from — the final thing — did it never strike you 
that their being together so much was, perhaps, indiscreet?” 

“Perhaps that was foolish of me,” the Baroness said, 
feeling that she could now afford to concede so much 
Then her anger flashed “If I had known there were so 
many lying tongues even m our own family, I should of 
course have warned Julie and Mr Alison ” 

“But you didn’t speak to either of them?” 

“My dear Marietje, why should I? They were friends 
and no more The possibility of their being anything else 
never entered my head ” 

At this her husband intervened again, eager to make an

end She smiled and acquiesced It pleased her to think 
how near they had come to success, how they had stumbled 
and fallen short of it When they apologized she would be 
magnanimous Magnanimity would cut as anger could not 

“Now,” Allard’s wife said, “I can prove that you are 
not speaking the truth, Ella, and have not been from the 
beginning It was you who sent Mr Alison away We can 
prove that ” 

It was a bow drawn at a venture, the Baroness thought 
They were trying to confuse her Alison would not tell, 
nor Julie, nor Ramsdell It was impossible that Marietje 
should know 

“I did nothing of the kind ” 

“Then how did you know before any of us that he was 
going?” 

“I did not ” 

“But you told Kerstholt You told Kerstholt on the 
morning before ” 

She remembered now — Sophie in front of Allard’s 
house, picking her way through the mud She had taken 
out her handkerchief and waved 

“Oh yes,” she said with a vague, frightened smile “I 
had forgotten Mr Alison did tell me he had been re- 
called ” 

“So you did visit him?” 

“I was passing the cottage ” 

“One goes to the cottage or one does not The lane 
leads nowhere ” 

“Across the fields,” she said desperately 

“I see, it must have been an interesting walk across the 
fields It was strange, wasn’t it, that he should tell you he 
was going before he received the telegram — before he 
knew himself?” Marietje turned to the Baron “I was not 
here that evening But you were You heard him say that 
he had a telegram from the Hague in the afternoon?” 

“Anyone may — may make a slip in conversation about 
the time of a telegram Obviously he did, if he knew m the 
morning A few hours,” he added weakly “What do a 
few hours matter?”

“What matters is that there was no telegram You will 
find that out at the post-office Alison was lying to cover 
Ella, and Ella kept quiet to cover him It was she who sent 
him off because she knew that he had been Julie’s lover, 
he was poor and useless, she was afraid that Julie might 
run away ” 

“Now,” said Sophie, “perhaps you will believe that I 
have eyes ” 

The Baroness, looking up, saw that they were in the 
dark, only the firelight illumined their faces and hands 

“It is true,” she began without knowing what she 
wished to say, “it is true that — in a sense — after Rupert 
died and Julie was a widow, I — — ” 

“I will not endure this,” the Baron exclaimed “You 
are like bloodhounds, all of you I will not listen — now 

You will go, please I must see you all again 
when ” 

He turned away abruptly that they might not see his 
face When he had been gone a little while, the others 
moved Goof went last, having paused to throw a log on 
the dying fire All wrong, all wrong, he thought We’ve 
hurt no one so much as the old man And hearing Sophie 
m the doorway say to Allard in breathless eagerness “Let 
me have tea with you 1 Let me come over to tea with you!” 
he hated his sister 


The Baron had climbed to the head of the stairs and 
was seated in a little alcove there Opening his hand, he 
found a twist of string and began to unwind it He won- 
dered where the stuff had come from and what to do with 
it You couldn’t drop it on the stairs, someone would trip 
and fall The sound of voices below recalled him The 
front door slammed Well, Allard had done his business 
Not Allard — he was led by the nose — but the women

about telegrams Questioning poor old Kerstholt* Ques-

Mixing servants m van Leyden affairs As for Ella — 
his thought choked there, and he watched Jacob walking 
across the hall with two branched candlesticks in his hands, 
spilling the grease, the idiot Julie, she wouldn’t do 
that, not she Not hole-m-the-corner, with her husband 
at the wars She wasn’t French' But my God, he thought, 
the library and that staircase and her bedroom up above 

I suppose even the English are cold on winter’s nights! 

And what a pother she was m at the Hague that time' Had 
to give her sapphires Then down to the Hague he came 
Why to our hotel? Was that the beginning — under my 
nose? No wonder he took so much interest in Dirk’s 
papers 

Then, suddenly, he could see nothing but the shame 
and dishonour of it His guest His Julie She wouldn’t

As he approached the tower, he heard the sound of her 
clavichord Half an hour ago, he thought, how I should 
have loved to sit quiet and listen, and there I was in my 
room, grubbing money She may have been playing then 
He went in without knocking so that he might not disturb 
her, but she looked over her shoulder, her eyebrows went 
up and she smiled — glad to see me, he thought He made 
a face at her and signed with his hand that she wasn’t to 
interrupt music for him, and down he sat, crossed his 
legs and clasped his hands about a bony knee Byrd, was 
it? and he forgot that there were spiteful women in the 
world But his eyes, staring out into the music, perceived 
that the door leading to her bedroom stood open, his 
purpose came back to him and, ceasing to enjoy the music, 
he wished only that it would go on and on She stopped at 
last and turned round in her seat 
“Well, Oom Piet, it’s not often you come to the tower 
nowadays Shall we have tea brought up here — for a treat? 
Then I’ll play again My fingers are cold ” 

She knelt at the fire to warm them and reached for a 
log from the basket

upright, she comfortably back on her heels with hands 
stretched out, rosy and golden 
“This is a devil of a business,” he said 
“What, Uncle Pieter?” 

“D’you know what they’re saying of you — that all the 
time Alison was sta} tng here, working in the library, you 
had that staircase open and — well, you see how it is? 
Sophie’s at the bottom of it, but the others are m it too 
They say your mother knew ” 

He was shaking 

“Tell me what has happened,” she said “I don’t 
understand yet ” 

He stared at the flames and told her 
“All I want is your denial, Julie I don’t want explana- 
tions Telegrams, Kerstholt — they don’t touch me, I’m 
not an attorney You’re my daughter, I count you so, you 
tell me it’s a lie and I’ll wipe the floor wuth them I

forget I ever came to you with this dirty thing, I’ll take it 
generous of you You go on playing your clavichord 
That’s enough answer for me ” 

She moved her hand towards his but did not take it 
“It is true, Uncle Pieter,” she said 
He stumbled up from his knees and looked down at her 
“In this house*” 

“Yes ” 

“For how long?” 

“Does that matter? Soon after Lewis came here until — 
until Rupert came back ” 

“Julie, it’s impossible in you Shameful ” 

“No,” she answered steadily, “not shameful But for

you should have known I wasn’t going to disgrace you or 
break up my marriage It was to be — what you called it —

“But, Julie,” he said, “I’m not a preacher — God knows

“You must ” 

“And afterwards — how am I ever to stand m with you

him “It can’t ever be the same I used to enjoy whipping 
them off I thought I knew you better than any of them 
and that though you were” — he picked the word — “high- 
spirited, still ” After a long pause he added “You’ve 
let me down ” 

“I’m sorry, Uncle Pieter ” 

“What’s to be done now?” he said “I’ll have to face 
them There’s nothing I can say ” Then with a little 
movement towards her that was not completed “You’ll 
have to face them too ” 

“It makes no difference to me,” she said, “what they 
say or do or think That’s true I’m sorry you should hate 
me, that’s all ” 

“Not hate you, child God forbid ” 

“Despise me, then Feel that I 

He did not deny it, but walked across the room without 
looking at her and let two of his fingers rest for a moment 
on the keys of her clavichord 
“Well, there’s no more to be said, Julie ” 

And he went out 


At the door of Alhrd’s house, his collar round his 
ears and his nose buried in a muffler, he made the bell 
peal wildly, and, when the manservant opened the door, 
shouldered past him without a word A lighted window 
had told him in which room they were sitting 
They had finished tea Allard had a cigar alight and his 
slippers on Marietje and Goof were playing picquet 
Sophie had taken a fan out of a case on the wall and was 
fanning herself — flutter, flutter — why couldn’t she be still?

“Come in, father,” Allard said, and began to make 
room by the fire 

“Fm not staying ” 

He loosened his muffler and remained standing This 
was what Julie had brought him to, this humiliation — to 
come here and confess that she was rotten Manetje, he 
knew, imagined herself to be a tactful woman She would 
keep her eyes on the cards and be careful not to smile 

“Well,” said Sophie, reading his face, “what do you 
think of your daughter now?” 

His daughter, the word was like a spur 

“Allard,” he said, “Fm speaking to you now as my 
eldest son ” 

“Very well, sir ” 

“You will succeed me here You will be head of this 
family ” 

“I understand that ” 

'‘Then please understand this — all of you I have not 
abdicated Is that plain? Good Now, I have seen 
Julie What you say against her you say against me Who-

That is all I have to say You have wronged me It is 
forgotten ” 

“We have not wronged you!” Sophie cried “You know 
ft is true* Why should it be forgotten?” 

“Because I have forgotten it,” he said 


When he had left her, Julie did not move Soon the heat 
of the new logs he had thrown on the fire began to scorch 
her face and she put up her hands to protect it Whenever 
he sees me, he will be ashamed, she thought, and, remem- 
bering how his mouth had worked, rumpling up his 
moustache, while he stood beside her clavichord, and 
how his eyes had held the look that came into them always 
when he was speaking of one whom he had loved and who 
was dead, she said aloud, “I shall hurt him less by going 
than by staying ” 

She went into her bedroom and put mto a suit-case a

few clothes, her jewels, her personal papers and German 
passport, what money she had and three books Then she 
wrapped herself in fur and for an instant was still, not in 
hesitation 

If the wall-staircase had been open she would have 
chosen to go down by it, but the lower door was bolted 
she would not see the library again, but one doesn’t look 
back going out of an enchantment, she said, and as she 
crossed her music-room, did not look at her clavichord 

The ball was empty A glint in the upper lake reminded 
her that she had not extinguished the lights m her room, 
and suddenly she thought How strange it will be to come 
into a town where the advertisements are written in 
English 1 She passed the tennis-courts and through the 
wood by the pavilion The lane to the cottage was very 
dark, but she was thinking of it as it had been in the sun- 
light of the afternoon on which they had received news 
of Jutland, and, when she reached the gate, the darkness 
of the cottage against the sky, its black roof and the 
wintry stillness of the trees, shocked her by their unfamih- 
anty There was no light to be seen m any window Was 
Ramsdell out and the place shut? If she walked round the 
cottage she would meet the Kerstholts, they would look 
at the case she was carrying She knocked at the front door 
softly, afraid that, if her knock sounded through the house, 
Kerstholt would come There was no answer She thought 
Ramsdell too has gone to the Hague I can’t go back 
I can’t go back I can’t now She knocked again 

The door opened and Ramsdell’s voice said in Dutch 
“Who is it?” 


She laughed “Julie 1 ” 

“Julie' Why, what have you there? Not more papers 
of Lewis’s?” They were in the little passage now, in the 
gleam of a candle he had set down on a bracket It was in 
Shat comer, she thought, under the bracket, I put my tennis 
racquetwhen I came herewith Lewis afterwe had hadnews 
of Jutland “Why, Julie,” Ramsdell exclaimed, suddenly 
putting his arm under hers, “what’s wrong? You look like 
death ?>

“I thought you weren’t here,” she said “I thought 
you’d gone ” 

He put down her suit-case and took her to the upper 
sitting-room It was littered with wooden boxes and pack- 
ing straw 

“Are you all right,” he said, “while I get you some 
water? There’s none here ” 

“I don’t need water I was only afraid you’d gone ” 
“Such a loss, Julie?” 

“Yes Ramsdell ” She stopped “I always call you

“People do,” he said 

“But you have another name ” 

“Not that matters ” 

“Tell me ” 

“Well, oddly enough, it’s the same as his — spelt differ- 
ently, though Louis ” 

“I see,” she said 

He lifted a packing-case off a chair and lowered a pile 
of books into it 

“What’s wrong, Julie?” 

“I oughtn’t to have come to you,” she answered 
“And why not?” 

“Because ” 

“Because I feel about you — as I do? That’s a reason for 
coming if you’re m a tight corner ” He added, looking at 
her “I’ll do what you want — anything on God’s earth ” 
“Take me to the Hague,” she said 
“To-mght?” 

“Now You still have Ballater’s car?” 

“I have But why car? It’s a long way ” 

“I want to go by car We can talk — and move It will 
be exciting There’ll be a moon later ” 

“Very well,” he said “I can take m more petrol m 
Rynwyk If you’ll give me five minutes, I’ll put some 
things m a bag ” 

She held out her hand “You’re good,” she said “No 
questions?” 

He smiled “That’s the advantage of coming to me ”

And before she had need to answer, he added quickly 
“There’s one question, though I take it no one knows 
about this or you wouldn’t have come here What are they 
going to say in the morning?” 

“They can say I’ve gone to the Hague That I’m going 
to England when I get passports I’m known to have rela- 
tions there ” 

“You’d better leave a message,” he said “Write it while 
I pack My one remaining servant is out, but I’ll leave it 
to be delivered m the morning It can be addressed in my 
handwriting Kerstholt needn’t know you’ve been here ” 

Soon he came in again, bag in hand The envelope was 
ready for him and he addressed it as she told him 

“Now 

“Oh,” she said, “thank God, you were here Thank God 
for that Can you manage my passports as easily as you 
manage me?” She was making plans and did not pause for 
his answer “Do you think,” she said, “if I stay at — at the 
Deux Villes ” 

He looked at her “Are you still so rich?” 

“Until I leave Holland I must be ” 

He nodded and blew down the chimney of the lamp 
“Right You must Well?” 

“If I stay there until the time comes, do you think we 
could sail together?” 

A spasm of pain twitched his mouth “You and Lewis? 

It might be Depends if he has to take men across 
They’re mostly gone, I think ” 

He opened the door for her, holding the candle up She 
took it from him and looked round the room The shadows 
leapt and, because her hand was unsteady, would not be 
still 

“You’ll come back here,” she said slowly 

“I shall have to This infernal packing is scarcely 
begun ”

THE BEGINNING 


“Don’t go,” Julie said “Not yet,” and Lewis, turning his 
head to look at the clock on the wall of the chart-room, 
touched Ramsdell’s arm and added “Stay another quarter 
of an hour ” 

Ramsdell’s lips began to smile It sprang into his mind 
to say “But I should have thought you’d have wanted to 
be left alone 1 ” But he could not mock them, he was too 
near m sympathy to their undertaking, and, saying nothing, 
he stared down with them from the bridge-rail on to the 
quay, and the bleak expanse of the dockyard, and the dark, 
tangled background of Rotterdam 
The Starling should have sailed early m the afternoon 
watch, and Ramsdell, having said good-bye, should have 
been on his way to Rynwyk But a later train would bring 
him home that night, and, when the sailing had been post- 
poned, he had waited, perceiving that the delay and their 
confinement m the little ship were intolerable to them Now 
he said 

“I wish you could have been married before you left ” 
“Why?” 

“Over and done with, I suppose ” 

Julie smiled “It’s clear m our own minds,” she an- 
swered “That’s what matters ” 

Silence fell over them again, and when they spoke it was 
of the affairs of the journey — the stowing of the baggage, 
the three other passengers who, the Consulate had decided, 
were to cross the North Sea m this little merchant ship, 
the probable time of arrival in England, or of the final 
arrangements that Ramsdell must make before he left

Enkendaal Lewis remembered a debt of eight florins and 
took out the money with which to pay it 

“No more walks up from Rynwyk on Saturday morn- 
ings, Ramsdell said “I must call on the Belgian and his 
daughter before I go ” 

“And you must come to see us in England,” Julie an- 
swered 

“I will ” 

“But at once? At Cheppmg?” 

“Shall you be at Chopping?” 

“Why not?” 

Ramsdell hesitated “You will be going away for a bit 
together?” 

She turned to Lewis “It will be better to settle down 
at once?” 

He put his hand over hers, gripping the rail, but he 
answered Ramsdell “Cheppmg at first Then London 
There are rooms over the publishing house that we could 
live m They’ll have to be cleared of stock ” 

Ramsdell knew that, while he remained, they would con- 
tinue to play the rigidly unemotional parts they had assigned 
to themselves When he was gone — he who was their last 
contact with the past — they would be compelled to face 
each other and the future, and the very fixity of their de- 
termination made him think they were afraid — were steel- 
ing themselves While Julie was insisting that he should 
laugh at two Dutchmen seated on a bench, with their two 
dogs beside them m the same conversational attitude as 
their masters and with bullet heads and planted feet that 
were a caricature of the human pattern, he looked carefully 
at her face, asking himself what chance she had of living 
as she now intended to live She turned her head suddenly, 
caught his gaze, interpreted his question and the tender- 
ness of it towards her, and, seeing that Lewis had crossed 
the bridge to speak with one of the ship’s officers, she said 

“You’re afraid for us?” 

It was hard to reply He trusted them, he believed that 
what they were doing was right and inevitable, but he saw 
darkness ahead 



THE BEGINNING 


4*7 

“Not if you are unafraid for yourselves But you have 
told me nothing, Julie, since I brought you to the Hague 
that night I’ve never known anyone so excited as you 
were on that journey — as if you were drunk — until, 
suddenly, you were asleep m the car And next day, after 
I’d left you with Lewis, you became all stiff, and reason- 
able, and determined Both of you — like rocks — towards 
me and towards each other ” 

“It’s better to pretend that than to pretend the other 
thing,” she said m an airy tone 
“What other thing?” 

“That we’re madly in love for the first time That every- 
thing’s romance and plain sailing That we see a honey- 
moon and no further ” 

“But you’re happy?” 

“Deep down ” She threw up her head “Ports are 
melancholy places I shall be glad to be at sea ” And she 
added “Happy? Not all dazzhngly happy Perhaps I 
should be even that, if this were a spring day, not winter in 
Rotterdam But that’s feeling, and, if I’m happy now, I’m 
happy because I think, the feeling may come — I don’t 
know And whether I’m happy or not matters less than it 
did If we are to live at all — with any real life, I mean, not 
a life of regrets and memories and shadows, then we must 
make our lives together, Lewis and I ” 

But Ramsdell who, though he knew the perils of her, 
saw in Julie the woman, and the only woman, for whom he 
would have abandoned reason, could not perceive, beyond 
what seemed but a friendly coolness between the two 
travellers, a possibility of love renewed To him, as to all 
lovers, there was no love but his own, all else was friend- 
ship, no more, and between man and woman that had 
been lovers friendship was sparkless He felt that these 
two were doomed, that they were attempting the im- 
possible, and knew it, and, feeling this, he was suddenly 
possessed by admiration of their attempt To this adven- 
ture they had been compelled, this was the fate, the irony, 
the unrelenting natural stroke that had hung always over 
the love that they had believed to be encircled Now they 



428 THE FOUNTAIN vn 

must carry that love with them through the world, vindi- 
cating and fulfilling it In the long run, he thought, 
consequence, which it seems possible to eliminate, always 
compels men to become either greater or less than they 
were — to become less in shrinking avoidances, or greater 
in acceptance, and he understood for the first time m what 
circumstance of love Lewis and Julie stood They were not 
afraid of what might befall, but m awe of the prodigious 
and continuing power of what had befallen, and while it 
was still possible, from the very outskirts of the past, to 
look back with wonder upon the garden now closed, they 
were slow to advance into that external world towards 
which, out of their dream, fate and their own resolution 
were carrying them 


“I must go,” he said “There’s no other tram And the 
captain is coming on to the bridge Soon you will be away ” 
“Lewis, he’s going,” Julie called, and Lewis came up 
beside them Little words were exchanged — messages to 
Enkendaal, promises of England whither Ramsdell would 
follow them in a week Soon he was on the bridge-ladder 
and they were looking down on him 
“I’ll go down to the gangway with him,” Julie exclaimed, 
and Lewis also would have gone, but he understood 
suddenly that she wished to be parted from him for a 
little while, not to stand at his side and wait 

“I will come up again,” she said “Are we allowed on 
the bridge when the ship’s under way?” 

The captain had invited them, Lewis replied He saw 
her run down the ladder like a seaman, facing outward, her 
palm under the rope, and turned away to look down again 
from the ship’s side If we sail now, he thought, we shall 
be beyond the harbour before dark, but there’s little time 
left, and impatience drove him to look continually at the 
clock m the lighted chart-room where the captain was 
stooping over the table with a pair of dividers in his hand 
At last the captain came out of the chart-room and went 
to the compass on the upper bridge There was a grinding 



THE BEGINNING 


429 

of capstans fore and aft, a creak of hawsers, a flop of hemp 
into the water of the basin On the quay and in the ship 
itself the processes of going to sea went forward 

Long after the Starling was clear of the inner harbour, 
land remained m sight The captain, coming down from 
the upper bridge, began to tell of the many voyages he 
had made across the North Sea, independently and under 
convoy, during the war He was proud of them, and, 
though he said that he was glad that the risk of submarine 
attack was ended, there was a note of regret m his voice 
Lewis was always eager for the talk of men that spoke of 
their own profession, and until the captain, wondering 
why his passenger stayed so long on deck when he might 
be snugly below, went up to the compass again, he was 
content Alone, he became restless He began to hear the 
lash and scud of the darkening sea, the low thud of the 
engines, the sharper beat of the auxiliaries, and to re- 
member, with a shock of exile, the waterfall at Enkendaal 
From that past he was now cut off, and he turned into the 
future with a determination to be bound by no regrets to 
be freed from them by the final act which had brought 
him and Julie together into this ship But it was a harsh 
determination, needing as yet all the support of his will 
Cheppmg, Fells Square, Alison and Ford, he saw the old 
life returning The same Julie who had been for so long 
separated from it in his mind — the idea of whom had, 
indeed, consisted m her detachment from this old, re- 
gulated life of his — would now share it, and he began to 
pity her, to blame himself for having so eagerly received 
her There was, it seemed to him now, a great division 
between them — a division that must increase day by day 
and year by year if she was to maintain her own character 
m its integrity and he to fight again, m the world, his 
battle for spiritual independence He could not cease to 
fight it, it was m his nature, vamly or not, he must fight it 
to the end 

The clamour of a rising wind was in his ears Though 
the throb of the engines was under him, their sound was 
shut out If Julie spoke, he did not hear her, and not until

the pressure of her arm was within his own did he know 
that she was beside him 

“I have unpacked what we need,” she said 

“But you didn’t come up?” 

“Not until we were clear of harbour Was that 
cowardly?” 

The question touched him as none other could have 
done, revealing m her anew an aspect of herself which, 
m the despondency of waiting, had been withdrawn from 
his mind — a mingling of humility and adorable insolence 
against fortune which was hers, and hers only, like the 
flash and the surprising gentleness of her eyes “Was that 
cowardly?” — knowing the answer, she could afford to ask 
that question, yet, though there was a challenge, a lilt of 
defiance m it, it contained also that baffling note of sub- 
mission which, when she was a child, had made her, 
beneath all her challenges, so eager a pupil The same 
challenge, the same gentleness, had entranced him when, 
on his first day at Enhendaal, he had found her with 
Ballater beside the lake, again when she had come up 
behind his chair m the Baron’s room and had seemed to 
whisper to him, again as she took him for the first time 
through the darkness of her tower-staircase — always this 
mingling of contraries, of force and passivity, had shone m 
her and made her to him irresistible It was her own light, 
by which she faced the world, her courage, her authentic 
spirit, was, indeed, herself — the origin and strength of his 
love for her And it seemed to him now, as he looked at 
her, that he saw, not her only, but the spring of his own 
being, as though there were, and had always been, an 
identification between them more profound than their differ- 
ences It was as if, while watching a thing of beauty, he had 
begun to recognize and feel its beauty as a moving current 
within himself, and all his purposes were comprised m a 
single purpose — not to fail her As she depended on him, 
so he on her, to fail her would be to fail m all things now 
A fiery conviction m the same kind — quick in the heart, 
deeper and lovelier and stronger than the cold resolve that 
Ramsdell had observed — must have possessed her also

in the same instant She had felt a speaking tremor of his 
hand, had seen the movement of his head towards her, and 
they had told her what she wished to know — that, to 
whatever issue, he and she were staked finally on each 
other She asked no more, nor he 

She watched a tug, frosted with salt, drop astern into 
the dusk They spoke seldom, for the wind carried speech 
away, but they stayed a little while, hand m hand for their 
greater comfort, until the light was gone from the bronze 
clouds m the west, and the bow-wave, as it curled and 
spread under the bridge, began to shine in the increasing 
darkness

AUTHOR’S NOTE 

I am reluctant to burden a story with a note of any kind, 
but it seems necessary to indicate what system I have fol- 
lowed m my use of Dutch and German names 

A novelist may suggest ancient nobility m England by 
an invented name, but the great aristocracy of Holland is 
so narrowly restricted and so well known that any fictitious 
title would give a false, and probably ridiculous, impres- 
sion I have, therefore, been bound to choose, in van Ley- 
den, the name of a noble family extinct before my own 
sojourn m Holland It has the right ring and may easily be 
pronounced by English readers, I have chosen it for these 
reasons only The persons of my story are imaginary, and 
the family van Leyden has no connexion, even in my own 
mind, with any of my friends who received me and other 
English officers with generous hospitality during the late 
wars I have borrowed in Enkendaal a setting and no 
more 

A watchful reader will observe what may seem to him 
inconsistency m my use or omission of the prefixes van in 
Dutch and von m German The truth is that the use of 
them, particularly in Dutch, is extremely elastic and de- 
pends upon fine differences of meaning which even the 
kindness of the Dutch and German authorities whom I have 
consulted cannot reduce to a rule For example, an intimate 
friend may speak of Leyden, not van Leyden, a snob who

wishes to affect intimacy may do likewise In speaking of 
the Baroness van Leyden, I have used three forms the 
Dutch, Mevrouw van Leyden, the French, Madame de 
Leyden, which is in Holland sometimes used when English 
is the language spoken, for “Mevrouw” does not come 
lightly from an English tongue, and “the Baroness,” a form 
to which nothing in Dutch custom corresponds, but which 
was, within my own experience, more often used by Eng- 
lishmen than any other, and was accepted In each instance, 
I have relied upon my own ear, and, subsequently, upon 
the revision of my fnends, who shall not, however, be held 
responsible for any errors I may have made by having their 
names coupled with my gratitude for their patience
